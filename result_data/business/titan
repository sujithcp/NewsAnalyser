JM Financial Research maintains buy rating on Titan Company post March quarter results with a 12-month target price of Rs 380.
Titan's 4QFY16 report was below expectations, which were already subdued given the industry-strike in March and implementation of the lower PAN-card threshold.
"The management is quite confident of clocking 15-20% growth in jewellery revenue in FY17E, this is now a critical parameter for taking a constructive view on the stock, we believe," said the note.
Titan also announced acquisition of a majority stake in Caratlane, the leading online jewellery player in India with presence across the value-chain, to build its omni-channel presence in the segment.
