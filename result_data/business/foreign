US Secretary of State John Kerry said the country is prepared to take steps to prevent unauthorised parking of foreign money in America.
WASHINGTON: Amid reports that $ 800 billion worth of foreign wealth is estimated to be hidden in the US, Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday said the country is prepared to take steps to prevent unauthorised parking of foreign money in America.
"We will be part of the solution, I assure you.
I guarantee you that the United States is going to be at the forefront of making sure there is accountability because we believe the theft of these vast sums of money from many nations in the world is part of what contributes to radicalism, to extremism, to terrorism," Kerry said.
He was responding to questions in an interview on CNN over reports in the aftermath of the leak of the Panama Papers that the US is a growing and massive offshore haven for a lot of foreign wealth that wants to be hidden, anywhere from South Dakota to Las Vegas.
"We're taking steps with respect to specific states, where we think there's been a problem and people trying to bring their wealth in, buying real estate and using the real estate as a hedge against what 's ever happening elsewhere," he said.
Parking of unauthorised money in the US, Kerry observed breeds an incestuous disrespect within a country for the political system and it hurts everybody by robbing from people their health care, housing, education , infrastructure, and their investment for the future.
