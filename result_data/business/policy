When travelling abroad, people usually prefer to opt for overseas travel insurance .
The insurance policy covers any accident, loss of baggage or important travel documents, and provides medical support if necessary.A travel insurance policy is typically taken for the period during which the insured would be travelling, but sometimes the duration of the stay may be extended.
Since the travel policy is effective only for the specified period, it is important to get the policy term extended according to the revised return date.
When to apply Extension of the travel insurance policy term is required to be made before the expiry of current travel policy's coverage.
It is a good idea to carry out the extension process at least 7-10 days before the expiry of the period.
The policyholder can do this even if he is travelling overseas.
All he needs is an Internet connection
Online request Request for extension of the policy can be made online by accessing the insurance company's website and filling up a policy extension form.
Previous policy details, reason for extension, claim details and details of any health conditions developed during the travel period are some of the details that need to be entered in the form.
Premium payment If the details provided are to the satisfaction of the insurance company , the insured can proceed to paying the additional premium calculated for the extended period of coverage.
This payment can be made online by credit or debit card, or through Netbanking.
Issue of extended cover Once the premium payment is done, a policy copy with the extended date is issued and emailed to the policyholder.
This email serves as proof of insurance for all purposes.
Points to note Some insurance companies may not allow extension of the policy if a claim under medical expenses has already been made during the previous policy term.
The policy is usually extended for a maximum additional term of 180 days
