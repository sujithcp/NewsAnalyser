 
The Border Security Force (BSF) has detained 18 fishermen and two boats from Pakistan for allegedly entering Indian territorial waters off the Gujarat coast.
The fishermen were caught fishing in Indian waters near the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
“On 11th May 2016 at about 1330 hours, a special BSF patrol party apprehended 18 Pakistani fishermen along with two fishing boats who were illegally fishing approximately four kilometres inside Indian waters in Nar Creek Area,” an official release said on Thursday.
The central agency handed over the fishermen and boats to local police for further interrogation.
“The apprehended fishermen are residents of Chhacha Jan Khan, district Thatta in Pakistan.
The place of apprehension is approximately 35 km from Koteshwar in Kutch district and approximately 4 km from Sir Creek,” stated the release.
Besides the twin fishing boats, the BSF also seized about 350 kg of fish, four fishing nets, a mobile phone, an ice box, a diesel tank and other items of regular use while at sea for fishing.
“We will lodge an FIR after interrogating the fishermen.
It appears that they crossed the IMBL and entered Indian waters in search of a good catch,” a police official from Kutch said.
