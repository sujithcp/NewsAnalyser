NEW DELHI: As Modi government completes two years in office on May 26, it has planned a month long campaign where ministers and MPs will highlight "achievements" and also apprise people of measures that were stalled due to "obstruction" by Congress-led opposition in Parliament.
At a meeting of BJP Parliamentary Party today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raked up the issue of imposition of Emergency in 1975 and told party MPs that younger generation should be apprised on its anniversary on June 26 on how an attempt was made "to crush democracy and who were the people behind it".
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters that in the meeting Modi spoke about the two years of NDA government and said that all ministers will travel to 200 main "nerve centres" across the country and inform people about their achievements.
"The Minister and MPs will also apprise the people about the laws and welfare measures which were not allowed to be passed in Parliament because of obstruction of some people and the damage that happened because of this.
People will be told about who are the people who have caused this obstruction," Rudy said.
The Modi government has been accusing the Congress of obstructing several of its reform measures.
Rudy said that MPs of the party will spend at least one night in their constituencies while they would hold interactions with people in adjoining constituencies and other areas.
The minister also said the Prime Minister spoke about how an attempt was made to "crush democracy" during Emergency and emphasised that the younger generation needs to be apprised of this.
In the meeting, the newly nominated members to the Rajya Sabha including Subramanian Swamy, Navjot Sidhu were also introduced, Rudy said.
