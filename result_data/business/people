Disaster struck the temple town of Ujjain on Thursday evening at around 4 pm during month-long Simhastha-Kumbh when a squall carrying heavy rains claimed six lives and left several injured.
Thousands of pilgrims were performing Snan (Holy dip) in Shipra river and completing their 118-km long Panchkoshi Yatra.
"The number of those killed in the incident may go up to eight and injured people may be 70-80," an official pleading anonymity told BS .
The injured were hospitalised in Ujjain hospitals.
Bad weather conditions were hovering over Ujjain since last evening and this evening a thunderstorm and heavy rains uprooted many pandals and tents where sadhus, saints, seers were camping with their disciples and devotees.
Although officials evaded confirmation of exact number of those died, but confirmed the number of dead referring to primary reports.
Many pilgrims, who flocked in from nearby village to perform "Panchkoshi Yatra" were present in the mela area and town.
Till today morning as many as 2 million people were present in the town and more are expected tomorrow as it will be Amavasya tomorrow (new moon).
During Panchkoshi Yatra pilgrims cover the distance of 118 km to perform Pradakshina and then take rest at bank River Shipra after Snan or Holy dip.
State chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in a statement, announced Rs 2 lakh each to next kith and kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to those who have received injuries in the incident.
However the statement did not mention as to how many people have been killed and how many received injuries.
Unconfirmed sources, officials of low-rank on duty and eyewitnesses have said many more might have injured as Mela has sprawled on an area of 3500 hectare where 22 satellite make-shift townships have been developed to accommodate at least 2 million people.
Technology and power both failed as a result the entire mela area plunged into darkness.
Those who were present at the Ramghat site told BS, "some people either injured or died as lightening struck them.
"As many as 70 people might have injured as the thunderstorm was of very high intensity," an eyewitness told BS telephonically, "a large size drainage pipe carrying city sewage also damaged at Ramghat and made it impossible for devotees to take holy dip in Shipra."
The temple town, known for Mahakal temple -- one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, is hosting mega religious event from 22 April to 21 May.
The state had expected 50 million people in the Kumbh mela this year.
Speaking to business standard, state spokesperson Anupan Rajan said, “Primary reports have said six people have been died while several others injured due to heavy thunderstorms but the number of those killed will be confirmed later as officials at present in Ujjain could not be contacted.”
Another official said from Ujjain told BS telephonically, “six people are reportedly died, many other pilgrims might have feared trapped in the tents and pandals.”
A woman pilgrim also died after being struck by a lightning bolt today, the official said but could not confirmed if she was among those six.
Thursday was a busy day for them as they were debating proposed Samrasta Snan called by BJP chief Amit Shah on 10th of this month in a bid to attract Dalits towards party fold.
Swami Swaroopanand had already protested the BJP Supremo plan who had invited members of all 47 scheduled castes members in Madhya Pradsh.
BJP chief Amit Shah is expected to take holy dip in Shipra river on 10th of this month while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to participate in an event Vaicharik Kumbh to be organized from 12-14 of May.
State chief minister has extended invitation to the prime minister yesterday in New Delhi.
The Simhastha Kumbh is based on the celestial movement of planets when Sun enters in Leo which occurs every 12 years.
