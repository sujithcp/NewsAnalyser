A lack of earnings growth momentum and progress on the reforms front in India are disappointing, but equities here may outperform, if key government reforms come through, says Luke Spajic , head of portfolio management, emerging Asia, PIMCO .
In an interview with Sanam Mirchandani , Spajic, who is based in Singapore, says he is neutral on Indian equities as valuations are expensive, but expects the rupee to outperform Asian peers, because of lower volatility around the debt market.
Edited Excerpts: Q- Do you think weak global economic growth concerns have been priced in by the emerging markets?
A- Weak global growth was well anticipated for 2016.
The first two months were deeply negative for risk assets, but there has been a significant rebound.
However, it is too early to call the rest of the year a success based on this rebound.
This year (2016) will see the worst of growth fears.
The emerging markets should start seeing better growth in the second half of 2016 and beyond.
Q- What would be the impact of Brexit on the emerging markets?
A- As we move towards this decision, uncertainty and risk premiums will rise.
I don't think that the Brexit would have very large implications for these markets.
Q- What is your outlook on India?
Is the valuation premium over other emerging markets justified?
A- We are neutral on Indian equities, as they look a bit expensive on some valuation frameworks.
The positioning has weakened, for sure, in emerging markets' funds, because investors had been overweight on India for some time.
Mutual funds may have been raising allocations in North Asia, but reducing allocations in India.
There is a lack of earnings growth momentum and there are outside risks such as Fed rate hike and rebound in oil prices.
The government needs to speed up the reforms process in banking and revitalise lending and help in better credit decision making.
If India can bring about tax reforms or land reforms, then equities will outperform.
Q- Do you expect FII inflows in India to sustain?
A- Very recently, there have been significant inflows across the board in the emerging markets.
Inflows have been in anticipation of good news on reforms.
If they don't come through, there will be disappointment.
India may look more attractive in terms of growth rate, but it has not translated into equity outperformance as we witnessed in the past 12-18 months.
Q- Should importers like India be worried if oil rises further?
A- The rebound is not necessarily worrying for India, given that it was trading at over $100 a barrel earlier.
As oil inches towards the $50-60 range, a large chunk of the benefit will be gone, but it is not a cause for alarm.
Q- What is your view on the rupee versus other Asian currencies?
A- We expect the rupee to outperform the other Asian currencies, given the stability in the economy and less volatility around the debt market.
With India targeting to bring inflation down to 4%, there is more room for the local asset market to outperform, which is the attractiveness that we look for in a currency.
Q- What is your outlook on the Fed rate-hike cycle?
A- The focus now will be on June and July for their next hike.
The Fed outlined labour market improvements and is suggestive of tighter tone.
We think that one or two rate hikes this year are a reasonable base case.
Q- Your views on Bank of Japan's move not to expand stimulus?
A- The reaction in yen was suggestive of some kind of policy activity being anticipated.
It is highly unlikely that the policy divergence we have witnessed has come to an end.
Q- Do you think turmoil in China's economy and stock market is over?
A- For sure, it feels calmer, with currency volatility being a lot lower.
There has been a significant boost to debt in the first quarter and tier-1 property prices have risen sharply in the March quarter, in some places.
But we are also seeing defaults rising in the onshore corporate bond market.
