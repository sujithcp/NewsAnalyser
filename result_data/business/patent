MUMBAI: A day after US company Gilead was granted a patent on hepatitis C medicine, sofosbuvir, patient groups and companies are planning to challenge it.
I-MAK and health advocates around the world agree that sofosbuvir does not deserve a patent, and will be launching an appeal to the decision.
The order may block a sustainable supply of key raw materials (APIs) for producing the drug in countries like Egypt, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and hence affect supply of affordable drugs, particularly in those countries, health activists say.
The pre-grant oppositions filed by Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, along with those filed by DNP+, I-MAK and three domestic generic companies were rejected by Deputy Patent Controller of Delhi Patent Office, Rajesh Dixit following hearings held in February this year.
The May 9 order overturned that of the Delhi Patent Office which had rejected the same patent on Sofosbuvir on procedural grounds.
Says Tahir Amin, co-director of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge: "Gilead's sofosbuvir was developed with previously published techniques that have been used repeatedly in other antiviral drugs and therefore does not deserve a patent.
In fact, Gilead's unjustified patents for sofosbuvir have already been rejected by China, Ukraine and Egypt.
With pressure growing from US trade regime and from Gilead's manipulative licensing deals, the patent office's latest decision ignores the truth about sofosbuvir and fails to uphold the standards of Indian patent law.
I-MAK and the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+) will appeal the decision to ensure the Indian patent system stays accountable to the integrity of the law and to the public's health."
Responding to the order rejecting the pre-grant opposition, Eldred Tellis from Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust said "This comes as a huge disappointment to us.
We know there was a lot of pressure to grant the patent considering Gilead had already signed licensing deals with Indian companies but we hoped to knock off the patent."
In September 2014, even before the patent on Sofosbuvir was granted here, Gilead entered into licensing agreements with seven Indian companies which has now increased to 13.
But most high-burden and high-income countries are excluded from the scope of the license.
"Knocking off the patent would have meant that non-license companies could have entered the market and forced further price reductions and potentially also supply to countries left out of the licenses" he added.
It is estimated that 180 million people around the world are living with HCV.
HCV is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact and may also be transmitted through unprotected sex in high risk groups.
Up to 80% of people living with the virus develop chronic HCV, which, if left untreated, can lead to life-threatening complications, such as liver cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer.
Sofosbuvir, a highly effective and safe drug to treat HCV, is now considered the backbone of the treatment regimen prescribed by the World Health Organisation and is also listed on the WHO's Essential Medicines List making it a high priority drug for HCV treatment.
Sofosbuvir is priced excessively high in most high-income countries, around $84,000 for a 12- week course in the US, and $76,000 in France putting considerable strain on national health budgets.
In India, the same treatment costs around Rs 20,000 under the generic versions of Sofosbuvir.
"Prima facie the order lacks legal reasoning but we need to examine it closely to figure out chart out a future course of action.
We will explore all options" said Anand Grover senior counsel and director, Lawyers Collective who appeared for Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust.
"There are other patent applications pending on forms of Sofosbuvir so it is important for us to stay on course and fight them out."
