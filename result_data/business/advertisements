An investigation by the Indian Express has revealed that the Madhya Pradesh government has spent over Rs 14 crore on advertisements to 234 websites over a period of four years.
Many of these websites, it has been found out, are run by relatives of journalists based within the state.
These websites have reportedly been identified in a list that was prepared by the government as response to a question in the state Assembly by Congress MLA Bala Bachchan.
The report revealed that costs of the advertisements placed on these websites ranged between Rs 10,000 to Rs 21.7 lakh.
The newspaper also revealed that:
1.
Out of at least 26 websites that got advertisements worth Rs 10 lakh or more, at least 18 are run by journalists or their relatives.
2.
At least 81 websites, many of them associated with relatives of journalists, received advertisements worth Rs 5-10 lakh.
3.
Some of the websites identified by Indian Express are http://www.failaan.com (Rs 18.70 lakh), http://www.citychowk.com (Rs 11.90 lakh) and http://www.prakalp.org (Rs 10.60 lakh).
The listed addresses for http://www.failaan.com (Prakhar Agnihotri) and http://www.indiannews&view.com (Rs.
8.75 lakh, Rajesh Agnihotri) are the same.
Anupam Rajan, commissioner for public relations, Madhya Pradesh in relation to the advertisements said, "Web sites are the new news media.
Money was given to popularise this new medium, no matter who runs those sites."
However, he added that the policy of giving advertisements to websites has now been changed.
The government now checks whether a website is actually working or not before the money is paid, he said.
"Besides, we give advertisements now only after getting reports of the number of hits on the site.
We cannot do anything if any of these web sites shut down after getting advertisements,” Rajan added.
MLA Bala Bachchan said, “Advertisements should go to actual news portals run by genuine journalists.
Why are advertisements being given to web sites of people associated with the BJP and some journalists?"
Journalists linked to websites and their reactions:
