NEW DELHI: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has set up two steering committees to work out a comprehensive strategy for production of satellite launch in partnership with industry/private sector, the Lok Sabha was informed today.
Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh also stated the panels are expected to submit their reports by the second half of the current year.
"...ISRO has set up two steering committees to delineate a comprehensive strategy for production with industry partnership," Singh said while responding to queries in this regard.
Replying to other questions, he said the terms of reference of the steering committee for 'stepping up launch capacity' include establishing production profile of the launch vehicles, assessing gaps in meeting production needs and arriving at a strategy for production including industry linkages, infrastructure build-up, technology sharing methods and quality assurance support.
The terms of the reference of the other panel for 'stepping up satellite/payload capacity', Singh added, include establishing production profile of satellites and payloads, assessing gaps in meeting production needs and creating a 'strategy map' for production, industry linkages, joint ventures, infrastructure build-up and quality assurance support.
The Minister noted the ISRO has been engaging the Indian industry since 1976 with appropriate transfer of technology and hand-holding for manufacturing of various components and sub-assemblies required for development of space technology.
He also said the industries have been realising several sub-systems including motor cases, structures, propellant tanks, liquid engines, control components and electronic packages while ISRO plays the lead role in carrying out the mission design, assembly and testing, quality assurance, integration and launch.
