The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) on Thursday denied reports that its website had been hacked.
" IRCTC website was not hacked and is functioning properly," Sandip Dutta, IRCTC public relations officer, told IANS.
"Passengers are able to book tickets through the website."
The denial by the IRCTC came following some reports in the media that a large volume of data had been stolen from the state-owned firm's website.
According to sources, the matter came to light when the Cyber Cell of the Mumbai police informed IRCTC that a large volume of data from its website was stolen.
"We asked the Cyber Cell to provide us with the data, that they claim belongs from our website.
Once we have the data, proper verification would be conducted," Dutta said.
IRCTC has also formed a six member high-level committee to look into the matter.
The IRCTC website contains vital information pertaining to passengers who book train tickets and avail other services through it.
Currently, IRCTC is one of the largest e-commerce firm in the country with three crore active registered users.
On an average, the website issues 5.5-6 lakh tickets per day.
