The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is all set to alter norms of the consent mechanism which will allow fradulent and unfair trade practices cases to go for an out-of-court settlement with the regulator.
The rider, though, is that this will be permitted only if the impact of the breach on the market was insignificant.
The markets regulator introduced the concept of a consent mechanim in 2007 to settle market-related violations, excluding serious frauds like insider trading and prohibition of fraudulent unfair trade practices (PFUTP).
But now the regulator is looking to widen the ambit of consent so as to mitigate the regulatory burden.
Speaking at the South Asia Risk summit, Sebi chairman U K Sinha said that the regulator is looking at bringing changes to the present norms.
"We have found that the total number of consent done in the year 2014-15 and 2015-16 has been coming down.
One of the reasons behind (it) is that there is a provision about the PFUTP violation cases, whether it has a marketwide impact or not."
The regulator defined PFUTP violation as an act by a issuer of securities which gives out wrong information that effects the market price of the security, effectively resulting in investors being misled.
"Our intention is to concentrate on more serious cases.
The circular with regard to this will be the next step as there has been a demand from certain experts that whatever Sebi has done may be it is good but it should do it through a regulation.
So we will be moving for changing in regulation up to that manner," added Sinha.
Currently, the criteria for marketwide impact is defined as cases that have a direct and significant impact on the securities market.
It is not limited to one listed security and its respective investors.
Subsequently, serious frauds like Insider trading,failure to make an open offer, non- compliance with an order, among others, cannot be settled via consent.
Sandeep Parekh, founder, Finsec Law Advisors said, "This is a welcome move.
This would ensure that enforcement proceedings are concluded in a short period of time for majority of cases and will also widen the ambit of the consent mechanism.
However, the present consent norms have some grey areas as well which need to be resolved, said legal experts.
"Enhancement of ambit of the said mechanism is a good idea.
But at the same time regulator has to clear the grey areas of the consent.
One, they need to make it hassle- free for people who want to settled the case through mutually- agreed fees.
Secondly, regulator need to provide clarity on the settlement fees, as the formula adopted for the settlement is very complex in nature," said R S Loona, managing partner at Alliance Corporate Lawyers.
The current process of consent is quite lengthy, say experts, as it has to go via three levels of checks through three different Sebi committees before arriving at the final consent terms which then typically takes several months.
Ideally it should be closed within a month which is possible if Sebi sets up dedicated teams.
In case of non-acceptance of the settlement amount, the application is treated as rejected.
The regulator clarifies that cases like RIL who are alleged to have done Insider trading while dealing in shares of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) will not be settled under consent.
These apart, Sebi is in discussion with global regulators to address issues related to high frequency trading (HFT) in Indian markets.
"(On) HFT, the market regulator is also independently working with its in-house team to recommend norms to take care of risks arising out of rising HFT," said Sinha.
To include PFUTP cases under consent; only cases with insignificant market impact eligible
