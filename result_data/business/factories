Diversified group ITC Ltd on Sunday said it is progressively resuming production of cigarettes.
“ITC cigarette factories have resumed production in a phased manner with the specified 85% graphical warning pending hearing by the Karnataka High Court”, an ITC spokesperson said.
Earlier, following Supreme Court's interim order last Wednesday, asking tobacco companies to comply with the Union health ministry's directive to print tobacco packs with 85% health warnings, cigarette major ITC had shut its factories.
“The company has had to shut its cigarette factories from May 4, 2016 until the company is in a position to comply with the interim requirements pending hearing in the Karnataka high court”, the company had said in a filing with the BSE on May 5 when it went ahead to shut its factories.
In April this year, the Kolkata-headquartered company had suspended rolling out the cigarettes at all its five factories stating lack of clarity in policy regarding printing of larger pictorial warnings on the packets.
However, following a High Court order in mid-April, it resumed production only to stop it again on May 4.
A notification by the Health Ministry on September 24, 2015, for implementation of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labeling) Amendment Rules, 2014, had come into force on April 1, 2016.
Production resumed in a phased manner with the warning, pending the hearing by Karnataka HC, the company said
