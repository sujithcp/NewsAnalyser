BENGALURU: If you have received an income tax notice and do not know how to answer it, this new online tool is for you.
Cleartax.in , the online tax-filing website has launched an e-tool to resolve I-T notice cases.
The service is free of cost and the site promises to resolve the issue within 24 hours.
All you have to do is quote your PAN number and upload the PDF file of the tax notice you have received and the experts will take care of the rest.
You will receive an email from the support team within one or two hours with the corrective steps.
If it is among the common notices—problem with your TDS claims, non-filing of income tax returns, TDS deduction on purchase of property, problem with reporting of income claims and deductions or a simple verification of your documents and scrutiny of your returns—the issue will be resolved within a day's time.
"While we have automated the process for the common notices, more complex issues have to be reviewed by our in-house experts and handled personally," says Archit Gupta , founder and CEO, ClearTax.in.
If you need the further support from the site, you may have to shell out a advisory fee between Rs 800 to Rs 1,600 depending on the complexity of the case.
Of late, the I-T department have been tightening their scrutiny and sending notices to taxpayers for a plethora of reasons especially for TDS errors, discrepancy in interest income filings, high value transactions and related taxes or those who have not filed their returns at all.
Apart from due taxes and penalties, the fines for not responding to these tax notices can be as as high as Rs 10,000.
