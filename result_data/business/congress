The Congress party will take to the streets here on Friday, in a protest against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government and its alleged “squashing of democracy” in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.
Party president Sonia Gandhi and Vice-President Rahul Gandhi will lead the ‘Save Democracy’ march from Jantar Mantar to Parliament, with the intention to “gherao” the latter.
Congress workers are slated to troop into the capital from neigbouring states.
The march will be a culmination of protests that Congress units have been holding nationwide.
Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told Business Standard, “We will be highlighting not just the elimination of democratically elected (Congress) governments in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh but ‘real issues’ that the Narendra Modi government wants to divert attention from.”
He alleged the ruling party was out to “vilify the Congress through false accusations and insinuations” and the Congress was determined to expose the “machinations” before the public.
At the protest march, the party will also raise the issue of an alleged crackdown in central universities on student activism and demand “proper investigations on the atrocities against students”.
They also alleged that the government is curtailing established procedures in Parliament, such as standing committee scrutiny of important Bills.
The BJP has said its members will be protesting against Congress scams at the base of the Gandhi statue in Parliament.
