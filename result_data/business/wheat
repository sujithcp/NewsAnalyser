Given that arrivals of new crop wheat was early in key wheat procuring states and major part of the procurement completed, there are indications of decline by 4-5 million tonne of wheat procurement over last year in the country's central grain pool.
While compared to last year it could be down 15 per cent but in absolute terms it will be a four-year low.
All India wheat procurement was recorded at 28.08 tonne last year.
The initial estimate of wheat purchase by the government agencies for the current Rabi 2016-17 was pegged at 30 million tonne and it was scaled down to 28 million tonne in the backdrop of drought in most parts of the country.
Total procurement of 21.5 million ton has been registered till today and it was 20.9 million ton during the corresponding period last year.
As the arrivals have slowed down in most of the grain markets, the procurement is like to diminish with residual arrivals only to be purchased.
According to reports, farmers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh this year, preferred selling to private buyers due to instant cash payment as compared to delayed payments by government agencies.
The residual arrivals too are bring cornered by private buyers in these three states.
Uttar Pradesh bucked the trend as wheat growers earned a price equal or slightly above Minimum Support Price of Rs 1,525 per quintal.
An executive in Food Corporation of India informed that the dent in procurement has come from an unprecedented private participation in wheat purchase and in some parts yield has been effected due to warm weather conditions in the month of March.
Cold temperature help in better yield of wheat.
This is a win-win situation for all stakeholders.
Farmers are earning a premium of up to Rs 150 per quintal for the normal variety of wheat in Madhya Pradesh.
The low moisture and high luster grain of wheat this year due to dry weather has pushed private trade into aggressive buying at a premium price.
Lower purchase with sufficient stocks for food security of the country would help government with cost saving.
The maximum dip in the procurement has been observed in Madhya Pradesh.
There has been almost a trend reversal as Madhya Pradesh had surpassed Haryana and clinched second position with 7.3 million tonne of wheat (next to Punjab) last year.
This year against the projection of 6.8 million tonne, the actual procurement is likely to close at 4 million tonne.
An import duty of 25% on the wheat has made Australian wheat unviable for the flour millers in down South.
"Madhya Pradesh wheat would cost us in the range of Rs 1,850-Rs 1,900 per quintal and Australian wheat is available to Rs 1,950-2,000 per quintal.
So an upswing in demand for Madhya Pradesh wheat this year is observed," told a miller.
Country needs 22 million wheat per annum for the public distribution system.
Food Corporation of India had an opening stock of 14 million tonne of wheat as on 1 April 2016.
So a fall of 4 million ton can be absorbed with availability required of food stock, informed the FCI Executive.
From 30 million tonne estimate it has been scaled down to 28 million tonne in the backdrop of drought in most parts of the country
