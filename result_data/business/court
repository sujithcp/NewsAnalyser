The government today raised in the Supreme Court the issue of restriction put on plying of diesel run taxis in Delhi and the National Capital Region, saying it will adversely impact the flourishing industry of BPOs which may choose to go out of India.
"The BPO industry would be affected as diesel taxis had been used for pick and drop facilities of the employees.
It will affect the economy," Solicitor General Ranjith Kumar told a bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur.
He also said that Centre will be filing an application shortly on the issue as it also pertains to the safety and security of the BPO employees.
"Due to the inconvenience caused to the BPO employees, the companies may choose to move out of the country which will be affecting the economy," the Solicitor General said.
To this, the bench also comprising Justice R Banumathi said why can't they (BPO companies) hire buses for the pick and drop facility.
Meanwhile, the counsel for Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) informed the court that it is discussing the issue arising out of the ban on diesel taxis with the Delhi government.
The apex court then asked the counsel to give the road map on the issue which would be deliberated upon on May 9, the next date of hearing.
The EPCA said that diesel cabs, which are not permitted to ply in Delhi and NCR, are being affected by the ban as they have an all India permit to travel to destinations across the country where CNG is not available.
The apex court had on May 3 given two days time to Delhi government to file a detailed plan on phasing out diesel taxis from the city after it had moved the court seeking the same.
The AAP government had said that in the wake of Supreme Court's order around 30,000 diesel taxis have stopped plying in the national capital which is causing inconvenience to the common people and creating a law and order situation.
The bench had then said whenever such decisions are taken, inconvenience is bound to be caused to people.
The Supreme Court had on April 30 refused to extend the deadline fixed for conversion of diesel taxis into less- polluting CNG mode.
The court had on December 16 last year considered the contention of senior advocate Harish Salve, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, that all diesel taxis be moved to CNG fuel within a reasonable time but not later than March 1, 2016.
