Soon after ministers in the NDA government were told to get serious about their social media engagement, civil servants at the Centre too are being given similar instructions.
Officers in the rank of joint secretary and above must highlight every achievement in the department ''prominently'' on social media accounts, a meeting chaired by Devendra Chaudhary, secretary, Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances (DAR&PG), decided on Monday.
This department is the nodal agency of the government for administrative reforms at the Centre and is expected to set an example for the entire bureaucracy.
In fact, every bureaucrat in the department will have to begin his day every Thursday, sharp at 10 am, with a session to discuss social media issues, as the minutes of the meeting suggest.
Officers at the director level have been mandated to provide relevant material everyday for placing them on social media websites.
An official pointed out that all central ministries and departments are in the process of institutionalising regular meetings and engagements on social media for civil servants, the key people responsible for actually executing policies.
Not leaving anything to chance, it has been decided that only a senior official at the level of joint secretary or additional secretary would approve the material for social media account.
Also, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speeches, statements and announcements must be ''projected suitably'' on the social media sites of the department, officials have been told.
The PM himself is a believer in the power of social media.
As among the most popular in social media, his account on the microblogging site Twitter @narendramodi has 19.9 million followers and @pmo 11.2 million followers.
Recently, he told his ministers that they would be graded according to their activities on social media, triggering competition among his Cabinet colleagues on tweeting and retweeting.
However, civil servants, apart from a few exceptions, have hardly engaged in social media interactions.
Apart from social media issues, Swachch Bharat is also expected to keep the civil servants occupied.
Activities relating to Swachch Bharat Abhiyan should be completed as per the plan/calendar and necessary evidence must be documented properly.
Besides, panel discussions would be organized on the flagship programmes of the award winning districts, it has been decided.
