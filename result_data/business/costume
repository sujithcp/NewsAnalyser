Characters from Gintama
As he fixes his wig, smoothens his coat and takes up the sword, Bengaluru-based Vijay Sinha ceases to be a game designer.
In the world of an anime/manga series called Gintama , Sinha steps forth as Hijikata Toushirou, a chain-smoking vice-commander serving an anti-terrorist force called Shinsengumi.
Known to be ruthless, fiercely loyal and cool as a cucumber, Toushirou's character is the substance of legends.
"He also has a weird fascination for mayonnaise and he comes with a whole lot of comedic expressions," says Sinha.
A former host for Comic Con India, Sinha talks of how cosplaying (dressing up as a character) is well on its way as a serious hobby.
While easily-recognisable characters such as Superman, Joker and characters from Guardians of the Galaxy have always dotted the scene in India, fans are using cosplaying to access and share an alternative universe that thrives alongside ours.
So when Delhi's Saniha Narendra comes dressed to kill as the deadly assassin Kitty Cat Katarina from "League of Legends" (a real-time strategy video game), or when Rohit Kailashiya becomes Shadow Shaman from "DOTA 2" (another online battle arena), they add to the ever-growing universe that is fuelled largely by the combined passion of video gamers, film and comic book buffs and anime/manga enthusiasts.
While the Facebook group Indian Cosplay Community has over 3,000 members, there are a number of other cosplay-focused groups online.
Every major city has its own anime club, or a group of comic book lovers, and a large number of cosplay enthusiasts come from these clubs.
"These local clubs are not just a good place to get to know other cosplayers, but they are also a good resource when it comes to finding good prop-makers and costume designers," says Sinha.Kailashiya, an MBBS student in Bengaluru, remembers when a Comic Con event would see 20-odd cosplayers.
"If you go on a Saturday or Sunday now, you'll easily see 200 of them," he adds.
Be it video-gaming events, festivals such as Japan Habba, Cool Japan or local cosplay conventions, cosplayers now have a number of spaces to meet others with similar interests.
"Gaming events often have cosplay competitions because they attract large crowds.
Besides, cosplayers often get hired for these events too," says Kailashiya.
For a recent photoshoot, Kailashiya spent close to four hours perfecting the costume.
Besides strapping on bits of leather, rexine and cloth, he used yellow body paint to pass off as Shadow Shaman.Cosplaying is a rather expensive interest too, as many have realised.
A number of cosplayers have now established themselves as costume and prop designers.
Kailashiya, under the label of Redemption Props, is one of them.
While Sinha has shelled out Rs 12,000 to Rs 13,000 for a single costume, the most expensive ensemble Kailashiya has worked on cost Rs 70,000 to Rs 80,000.
But it's not just the 'picture-perfectness' of a costume that makes for a good cosplayer, says Manish of Manish Lenswork.
Though not everyone is comfortable with donning a costume, fewer are those who can completely emulate the characters they portray, he says.
A shutterbug in his free time, Manish is steadily preparing to give up his day job to pursue a career exclusively photographing cosplayers.
Being a cosplayer is a gig that comes with a fair amount of pressure.
Besides the constant scrutiny when you are in costume, one also learns to be at ease when hundreds photograph you during conventions.
"Of course there are body shamers no matter where you go and you just have to prepare yourselves," says Kailashiya.
"And it's harder if you are a girl in costume.
But you can't let others affect your mindset or love for cosplaying.
You have to just ignore them," he says.
Kailashiya, like many others, feels the cosplay community is a very supportive one.While just being a fictional character can also be a lot of fun, going to conventions is the best part of it all, says Kailashiya.
Meeting other fans and the reception you get while in costume, tops the charts.
"Once I had to go without a costume and I didn't feel like a celebrity at all," he says, laughing, "I went home and turned up the next day wearing an old costume.
I just couldn't go there without one."
Gearing up with an ensemble complete with scythes, shields and swords is no longer a hobby that thrives on the sidelines
