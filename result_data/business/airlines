The Union aviation ministry will form two working groups to address issues related to capacity constraints and air traffic congestion at the Delhi and Mumbai airports.
The decision was taken on Thursday, at a meeting chaired by R N Choubey, the ministry’s secretary.
These two airports are the busiest in the country and also face capacity constraints.
More so at Mumbai, which has a single runway and no extra slots for airlines.
The working groups will comprise representatives of airlines, airport operators and the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
They’ll examine issues related to capacity, reducing airside congestion and runway occupancy, plus better navigation procedures.
At Thursday’s meeting, executives of the two airports made presentations on the issues and what was being done to improve air traffic movement.
Mumbai handles 45-48 movements an hour and on occasion over 50; a single runway means it does not have room to accommodate more flights.
There’s also a staff shortage at the traffic control tower.
KEY TAKEAWAYS Mumbai and Delhi airports are facing capacity constraints Mumbai airport has only one runway and no extra slots for airlines The working groups will comprise representatives of airlines, airport operators and AAI They will look at ways to reduce airside congestion and better navigation procedures The capacity constraints issue is hurting new airlines like Vistara Aircraft movement at Mumbai is 45-48 an hour
The capacity constraint issue at key airports (also at Chennai) is hurting new airlines such as Vistara, which is demanding a model for equitable distribution of slots among airlines.“A formula can be reached so that everyone gets a fair share.
New airlines need slots to grow or else there will be a duopoly or monopoly, not good for consumers.
Customers will also have an opportunity to experience new services and fares will be kept in check,” Sanjiv Kapoor, chief strategy officer of Vistara, had said in April.
