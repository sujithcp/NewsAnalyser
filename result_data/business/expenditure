According to the terms of reference, the commission was entrusted with examining various aspects of expenditure reforms to be undertaken by the government such as review of institutional arrangements, including budgeting process and Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) rules.
It was also to suggest ways to improve allocative efficiency in the existing expenditure classification system, and other issues concerning public expenditure management.
