Chandy said today that Kerala government paid for return of 29 Indians including 16 keralites from Libya
The ongoing battle between the Centre and Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy escalated on social networking site Twitter.
This time it was Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj who pushed out a series of tweets aimed at Chandy, reminding him that they had evacuated thousands of Keralites from strife-torn Libya, Iraq and Yemen.
The provocation for this attack by Swaraj on Chandy came from a statement that he made today about Kerala government paying for the return of 29 Indians including 16 keralites from Libya.
Chandy also said that they had to 'push' the Centre to act.
“In fact, we paid for travel,” Chandy said.
The war of words need to be seen in the context of the state going to polls on 16th May.
Chandy had earlier taken offence to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement linking the state's infant mortality rate among scheduled tribes to Somalia.
While Chandy sought an apology, the Prime Minister has maintained his silence on the issue.
Social media also witnessed campaigns with hashtag #PoMoneModi (Go Off Modi) thrashing at Modi over his comparison.
Twitteratis have also reacted to Swaraj's tweets, with some reminding both leaders not to play politics with rescue and relief work.
