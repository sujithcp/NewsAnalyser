'Bharosa', an integrated support centre for distressed women and children, was inaugurated here by Telangana Home Minister Nayini Narasimha Reddy.
Bharosa, an initiative of Hyderabad City Police, is a state-of-the-art centre to support women and children who are victims of violence.
The centre, which was announced on International Women's Day, will provide under one roof 24X7 services related to police, medical, legal, prosecution, psycho-therapeutic counselling and relief and rehabilitation.
The centre is equipped with well-trained staff and modern gadgets, including facilities like video conferencing, so that the victims need not go to the court.
"Today we have launched Bharosa, an integrated support centre for women and children who are in distress.
This will go a long way in preventing victims of extreme violence from moving from pillar to post to different institutions and agencies," Hyderabad Police Commissioner M Mahendar Reddy told reporters.
Its objective is to facilitate immediate, emergency and non-emergency access to a range of services and to work towards resolving conflict in families by involving civil society.
It also aims to monitor every case and take it to its logical end, the Hyderabad Police chief explained.
Aggrieved women and children subjected to violence due to attempted sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, trafficking, honour-related crimes, acid attacks or witch-hunting who reach out or are referred to the centre will be provided with specialised services, Reddy said.
This centre has been set up with the help of several NGOs and government departments.
