To bridge Haryana's "caste divide" Aam Aadmi Party will launch 'My Caste Hindustani' campaign in the state and its 'Kranti March' will start from May 14 from Rohtak - the epicentre of Jat stir for quota earlier this year.
" Haryana needs positive energy and we want to create an atmosphere where all 36 'biradaris' (communities) stand shoulder-to-shoulder and not look at each other with suspicion," said Naveen Jaihind, the newly-appointed Convener of AAP's Haryana unit today.
He said the "Kranti March" would start from Rohtak and subsequently would be taken out from other places as well.
"The state government remained a mute spectator to the widespread violence.
Leaders of ruling BJP went into hiding leaving the state to burn.
Some senior politicians from the ruling outfit and the opposition were out to sharpen the caste polarisation for political gains," Jaihind alleged.
Asserting that the violent stir had created a "divide" among various sections, he claimed, "the situation has come to such a pass that people from one community are seeing the other with suspicion.
Haryana's 'bhaichara' (brotherhood) was targeted just because of vote bank politics."
The AAP leader claimed that the situation "suited" ruling BJP also "as it has nothing to show of the tall promises it made to people before the 2014 Assembly polls".
"They promised pay scales for employees on par with Punjab, unemployment allowance but they have nothing to show the people," he claimed.
Naveen Jaihind cites recent quota stir, says suspicion and bad blood prevalent between communities
