A day after former Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh claimed that Amitabh Bachchan "warned" him to not accept his wife Jaya into his party, the megastar today said the politician has every right to say what he wants.
Singh, who was once very close to the "Piku" star and his family had claimed at an event in Mumbai on Thursday that Bachchan had once warned him not to accept Jaya in his political field considering her "inconsistent nature and habits".
"But I didn't adhere to his noble advice," Singh had reportedly said replying to a query at the launch event of Hindi film "Bhouri" here.
Singh was reportedly asked to comment on the Panama papers controversy in which Bachchan's name had cropped up.
But he instead went on to narrate how things went downhill between him and the Bachchans.
When asked about Singh's remarks, the 73-year-old actor told reporters here today, "He is a friend, he has the right to say what he wants to say."
The former Samajwadi Party leader was very close to the Bachchan family for many years before their fall out.
