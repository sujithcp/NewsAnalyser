Last week, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha member from Begusarai, Bhola Singh, known for his unconventional views on a number of issues, asked a minister in the BJP-led government at the Centre why policies relating to the hydrocarbon sector, especially as they related to a particular company, were not stable.
"We want to know the government's compulsions," he said.
Singh's questions drew an immediate response from Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who denied the government was succumbing to pressure.
"We have no compulsions, I want to make it clear," he said.
"Please remember the country's prime minister is Narendra Modi."
Singh replied: "I know the country's prime minister is Narendra Modi.
But I have faith in you also.
Aap toh Dharmendra hain, pradhan bhi hain [you are Dharmendra (the namesake of a yesteryear Bollywood actor) - and your name also means chief]."
