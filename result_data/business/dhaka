NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary S Jaishankar will visit Dhaka on Wednesday eyeing to review situation amid the spate of killings orchestrated by the radical groups that targeted liberal and secular personalities in the backdrop of Sheikh Hasina government's crackdown on extremist organisations and war criminals.
Jaishankar will meet senior Bangladesh officials to review security situation in Bangladesh, according to official sources.
He will meet his Bangladesh counterpart Shahidul Haque who was here in February for the foreign office consultations.
The Hasina government's continuous crackdown against the terror groups and extremist elements have been lauded by India .
There is anticipation that banned Jamaat-e-Islami might react following execution of its leader and war criminal Matiur Rahman Nizami.
Jaishankar's visit is taking place soon after US assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Nisha Desai Biswal trip to Dhaka following the spate of murders.
The foreign secretary's visit is also taking place amid diplomatic spat between Dhaka and Islamabad.
The Bangla government on Monday handed over a 'strongly-worded' demarche to Pakistani envoy in Dhaka in protest against the country's statement on Supreme Court verdict dismissing the review plea of Motiur Rahman Nizami.
In a May 6 statement, Pakistan foreign office has said: "We have noted with deep concern and anguish the dismissal of the review application on the death sentence by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh for Mr Motiur Rahman Nizami, the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami."
