Havells exceeded analyst expectations yet again, and this time on all fronts.
Net revenue of Rs 1,463 crore, up 9% year-on-year growth in March 2016 quarter (Q4FY16), was ahead of Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 1,448 crore.
Operating margins at about 15%, an increase of 170 basis points (bps) year-on-year, was also ahead of estimates of 14% and was the surprise element.
Net profit at Rs 366 crore, which more than trebled on the back of divestment proceeds from its overseas businesses, took the sheen away from the strong operational numbers.
The stock of Havells declined by 1.7% on Wednesday.
However, analysts say the Street's concerns is misplaced as net profit at Rs 164 crore (excluding proceeds from the stake sale, unadjusted for taxes) is still higher than Bloomberg estimates of Rs 150 crore.
Ruchir Khare of Kotak Securities asserts that the March quarter numbers of Havells is noteworthy with operating margin expansion being the positive surprise.
"Strong growth in the lighting business, driven by LED sales has helped Havells", he adds.
Some profit-booking in the counter could be another reason for the stock's fall, given the 27% rally since the start of March.
Lighting segment, which now accounts for about 16% of total business (14% in Q4'FY15), registered the highest revenue growth at 23% year-on-year in March '16 quarter.
That said, given the recent product launches, EBIT margin (earnings before interest and tax) for the segment declined by 124 bps to 24.5% in Q4'FY16.
As Havells plans to increase its consumer reach, advertisement spends may remain elevated.
Segments such as cables and consumer durables posted 100-230 bps expansion in EBIT margin, while switchgear division's improved from 29.6% in year ago quarter to 39% in Q4'FY16, thereby more than compensating for the decline from lighting business.
Going ahead however, Rajiv Goel, Executive President of Havells feels that with the downturn in commodity prices, 14% operating margins may be more sustainable in FY1.
Likewise, advertisement cost as percentage of sales may hover around 3.3% in FY17 (2.65% in Q4'FY16).
He is also cautious about growth in switchgear and cables divisions, where revenues grew by just 7% despite sales volume growth of 11-14% in FY16.
But with the return of consumer spends and its strong dealer network, consumer business particularly fans and electrical appliances may do the job for Havells.
Prior to the results, 20 out of 37 analysts polled on Bloomberg recommend 'buy' on Havells.
