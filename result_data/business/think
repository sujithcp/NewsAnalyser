In a chat with ET Now, V Vaidyanathan, CMD, Capital First, says allowing professionals and finance companies to enter banking really opens up the sector.
Edited excerpts ET Now: Professionals and finance companies will get a chance to set up banks but many large business houses which have long dreamt of owning such institutions may not be so lucky.
How important and crucial is this for companies, promoters etc who want to apply because from what I understand effectively corporates are out?
V Vaidyanathan: Yes.
I think this is one of the most significant moments in the Indian banking system.
When we wake up 15-20 years from now, we will figure out if the banking system has completely transformed because the existing public sector system which is only 70 per cent of banking in India are constrained for cash and therefore India does need a new set of bankers to power the economy ahead.
Seen in this perspective, I think it is a very-very significant moment.
The second reason why it is significant is that since about the 20 state owned institutions have the same shareholder, have the same set of hiring criteria, they have the same set of governance in terms of CVC, CBI etc.
They all therefore have the same kind of vegetation loans, they have the same home loans, they have the same of everything.
Everybody lends at base rate, everybody has a 20-year tenure and everybody has amortising schedules so there is not much differentiating.
So we should consider them as one bank.
If you see it like that, India has not more than maybe a 30 or 40 banks for a billion people.
US has 8000 banks owned by different owners for 300 million people.
So when you wake up many years from now you will realise that this is probably one of the biggest moments in banking history.
ET Now: But why have corporates been left out of the list?
V Vaidyanathan: I think it has been done very deliberately because corporates can always borrow from their own bank in some circuitous manner and even if their governance requirements do not allow them to borrow it, there could be a corporate A versus corporate B situation.
I lend to you and you lend to me...we are both kosher and we are busting the system.
Also it is not they are not allowing corporates but they are saying 60 per cent of the revenue has to come from financial services.
But allowing professionals to come into the space, I think, is a very significant moment because that really opens up banking.
ET Now: What does it mean for you at Capital First?
V Vaidyanathan: See at Capital First, we think about these issues all the time and we figure out what is a longer term roadmap as we evolve from here.
We think right now we have about Rs 15,000 crore asset base and we think over the next three or four years, it can go up to Rs 30,000 crore on loan book and deposits should not be a problem.
But if we take a longer term roadmap we do think that a banking license will definitely help.
We think there are two ways of getting there; one is through the universal banking licence and we got to really think hard about this because of the implications.
But the other route which has not come through yesterday but rather two three weeks ago is about the fact that you could even merge with an existing bank, in which case you get a deposit franchise, lending franchise and life looks good.
ET Now: You sound more favoured towards the latter, the one that came out three weeks ago?
V Vaidyanathan: Yes.
We really have not thought through which of the two options we want to go with or whether to stay NBFC for a longer time, but definitely we evaluate these options all the time.
ET Now: You mentioned that you will have to think through this universal bank norms because of the implications.
What would it mean for an NBFC if it does go for this current option?
V Vaidyanathan: There are two implications, one implication is that in terms of shareholding structure eventually allowing 74 per cent as foreign ownership, now in the case of Capital First we have 65 per cent owned by Warburg Pincus , we have got a substantial amount of FII stake, so we have got to figure this piece out in terms of Indian ownership being 49 per cent and foreign ownership.
I think the second issue which is not just for Capital First, and which is significant for anybody converting to a bank is the amount of CRR, SLR amount that you have to really originate overnight or at the time of becoming a bank.
I think these two factors will play on everybody's mind.
ET Now: How would life change for PSU banks?
V Vaidyanathan: Smart PSU banks like the State Bank of India are really doing fantastically well and they are evolving with the times.
There are maybe three or four or five other such banks which are doing equally well.
But for a number of them who are not founded on technology and are governed by the same norms of today, this new set of people (let us say 15-20 licenses that may get issued over the next two or three years) coming with new intentions, new niches, new target segments, new technology will dramatically put pressure on the, smaller PSU banks who are probably having existing systems to deals with.
