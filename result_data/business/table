The Income-tax office has released partial data on direct taxes paid in 2000-2015.
As Table 1 shows, direct taxes paid as a percentage of total taxes rose steadily before declining from 2009.
The decline is also visible as a percentage of GDP, in Table 2, though it is less sharp.
This change seems to have been accompanied by a reduction in the buoyancy of tax, as Table 3 suggests.
However, the number of assesses continued to rise for much of that post-2009 period, according to Table 4 (although a reduction has been observed in the last provided year, 2014-15; not all returns may have been filed).Tables 5 to 7 provide data on the range of tax payable by various groups of high-end taxpayers.
That there are only 157,000 taxpayers paying tax of over Rs 10 lakh, as shown in Table 5, may be surprising - as is the fact that there are only just over 55,000 taxpayers with salary of over Rs 50 lakh, as shown in Table 6.
The amount of tax paid by high-end Hindu Undivided Families, in Table 7, is also relatively small.
