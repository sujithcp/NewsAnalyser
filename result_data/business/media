"I hope there is a bad 'M' and a good 'M'.
We need the transition", Ratan Tata, then Tata group chairman, had said at a press conference in 2008 to announce Nano's relocation to Sanand in Gujarat.
The bad 'M' he was alluding to was the Mamata Banerjee who led an indefinite agitation against the project that ultimately led to its pullout from Singur in West Bengal; the good 'M' was Narendra Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister, who rolled out the red carpet for Nano and gave it a new home.
More than seven years since the life-changing event for Bengal, Mamata Banerjee appears to have found her bad 'M' in media: the Anandabazar Patrika group.
In the initial days of the campaign, Banerjee's tirade was covert, directed towards 'a section of the media', but the election has proved to be excruciatingly long this time and frayed nerves have made way for a more direct attack.
"They — CPI(M), Congress, BJP and ABP — have been continuously complaining about the elections, aami election er pore ekta lollipop aar balish debo oder (I will give them a lollipop and a pillow after the elections)," she said recently at a rally.
When contacted, ABP declined to respond to the issues raised against it.
There have been numerous such instances in the past few weeks when she has directly take on the ABP group and declared it a fourth opponent alongside the Congress, CPI(M) and the BJP.
Last week, Kolkata woke up to an unseemly flex in the election season.
No, it wasn't that of Mamata Banerjee or any of Trinamool's celebrity candidates; or any politico for matter.
It was a story "Why is Aveek Sarkar so desperate to credit Mamata Banerjee?"
by Millennium Post with a picture of the owner.
The flex was put up by Millennium Post as part of its brand promotion, said Durbar Ganguly, promoter of the broadsheet.
Though Trinamool Congress National Spokesperson, Derek O'Brien had retweeted the story, it is not to be taken as an endorsement.
"Anyone can tweet anything on Twitter," he said and then added, "People will deliver their verdict on May 19 despite the malicious campaign by Aveek Sarkar's ABP."
ABP may well be at the receiving end of the establishment's ire, but in the last few weeks, the media which has been polarised in Bengal for the past five years, appear to be in a quandary over the outcome of elections.
"This election will be remembered for its swings and if it swings in favour of the CPI(M)-Congress alliance then the media would have played an important role," political analyst, Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury, said.
But the Mamata-media equation wasn't always like this.
In the run-up to the assembly elections of 2011, she was a clear favourite.
In 2012, four journalists — Kunal Ghosh, Nadimul Haque, Vivek Gupta and Ahmad Hasan Imran — were nominated to the Rajya Sabha.
Ghosh was, however, suspended from the party in connection with the Saradha scam, later.
Bureaucrats say Banerjee was very much guided by media in her initial days.
The honeymoon continued till about six months of the new government.
But reporting of some events — like branding students Naxals, labelling Park Street rape case a conspiracy, arresting a professor for forwarding a joke, prescribing newspapers that state-run libraries should keep — made a bad 'M' out of media.
This time, it's Banerjee who needs a 'transition' to good 'M'.
