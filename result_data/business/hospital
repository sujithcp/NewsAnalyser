Mumbai civic administration's Health Department has launched a probe into an alleged incident of turning away patients by hospital staff as they celebrated 'Haldi Kumkum', a popular women's festival, and played loud music.
The hospital authorities, however, refuted that inconvenience was caused to patients due to the celebration.
In an anonymous complaint, it was alleged that in March, around 10 to 15 staff, including doctors, nurses and class IV workers of Diwaliben Mehta Hospital in Chembur turned away patients and played loud music while celebrating the festival.
Medical Superintendent and Supervisor of Diwaliben Mehta Hospital, Dr Pradeep Jadhav said, "Following a complaint filed with us, we set up a committee to investigate the incident and the report would be submitted in a day or two."
Jadhav added that as per initial findings, it does not concur that any rules were broken.
A senior official of the Health Department, requesting anonymity, said, "The allegation levelled against the staff is baseless.
Not a single patient has come forward to substantiate the charges."
"The festival was celebrated in several hospitals of the city.
All the patients were duly attended to as it was organised during post-duty hours.
Moreover, it was a ceremony only for women, and all male staff including doctors were at work," he said.
