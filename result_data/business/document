With due focus on implementing the new Constitution, carrying out post- earthquake reconstruction and holding local elections, Nepal's President Bidhya Devi Bhandari presented the government's policies and programmes for the upcoming fiscal year at the Legislature-Parliament.
"The upcoming fiscal will be marked as the year of Constitution implementation and of journey towards prosperity," Kathmandu Post quoted President Bhandari as saying while presenting the document yesterday.
However, with the absence of a deal with the Madhesi parties, who have opposed several provisions of the new Constitution, the implementation seems to be difficult.
The politico-economic document has focused on formulation of new laws and regulations in line with the new Constitution and restructuring of local bodies and administrative units under the seven provinces.
The top priority has been given to the passing of 138 new laws, which is essential for enforcing the charter.
The document vowed to address "genuine demands" of the Madhesis, but laid out no roadmap.
Lawmakers affiliated with the Madhesi Morcha boycotted the address citing the government's "lack of interest" in addressing the grievances of the Madhesi people.
The 32-page document described the economic loss the country faced due to the devastating earthquakes last year, followed by months of agitation in the plains and a blockade of the southern border at length.
The document, however, was short on detailed plans for recovery.
The document also highlighted the signing of historic trade and transit agreement with China, and amendment to 193 laws as major achievements of the government in the past seven months.
Apart from commencement of the distribution of the first installment of grants for reconstruction of houses, formal beginning of the reconstruction of heritage sites and public property were also mentioned.
Plans to implement the agreements signed with India and China during the official visits of Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli were also highlighted.
The policy to be discussed in Parliament today has set a timeline to complete the reconstruction of all the earthquake-damaged structures within five years.
The government has announced to hold elections at the local bodies, which have been without elected representatives for the last 14 years, in November-December.
The government has announced development plans for each of the seven provinces besides laying emphasis on compulsory and free education to be realised gradually up to the twelfth grade.
