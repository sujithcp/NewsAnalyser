Drug maker Sanofi has recalled several batches of its popular painkiller, Combiflam, after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) found the product to be of sub-standard quality at least twice during the past three months.
The DCGI had issued an alert first in February and later in April.
The regulator had said that the drug was not of standard quality, with delayed disintegration of the molecule in the blood stream.
The tablet is made at Sanofi's factory in Ankleshwar, Gujarat.
DCGI had tested Combiflam in February and April at its regional laboratories in Kolkata and Chandigarh, respectively.
"Some batches of Combiflam tablets were found to have a delayed disintegration time.
There is a pharmaceutical parameter that requires the breakdown of a tablet in the human body to be assessed.
In the case of Combiflam, though the disintegration time was delayed, doctors and patients can be assured that there is no impact on the safety and efficacy of the product," said a Sanofi spokesperson.
According to IMS Health, a global information and technology services company, Combiflam had annual sales (April 2015 to April 2016) of Rs 162.7 crore.
It is the leading brand of its molecule (ibuprofen+paracetamol).
Cipla's Ibugesic Plus is the second brand in this category, with annual sale of Rs 62.2 crore.
The other drug which DCGI found in April of sub-standard quality was Macleod Pharma's Orcerin.
The molecule's name is Diacerin and is used to treat joint pain and arthritis.
The regulator found 'related substances' in the tablets it tested.
Macleod Pharma did not respond to e-mailed queries from this newspaper.
IMS Health says Orcerin had annual sale of Rs 4.6 crore.
It is the top brand in this molecule.
Glenmark's Dycerin is the second one, with annual sale of Rs 3.6 crore.
DCGI had issued an alert twice, saying drug was sub-standard, as its disintegration in the blood stream was delayed
