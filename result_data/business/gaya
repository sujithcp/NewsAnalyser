Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav on Wednesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is yet not able to digest the splendid victory of the grand alliance, is making desperate attempts to gain political mileage of the Gaya road rage case by making unwarranted comments linking the same with return of 'jungle raj'.
Tejaswi said the BJP is advertising the Gaya incident in a way as if it is an extremely rare and first incident.
"There are many such cases taking place in the national capital.
Is there a 'jungle raj' here?
This is all being done to gain political mileage since the people of Bihar have given their mandate to the 'mahagathbandhan'," Tejaswi told the media here.
"If a relative of any accused is member of a party (it) does not mean that the lawbreaker enjoys protection of the power.
The law is doing its work and you see within two days the accused has been arrested," he added while silencing all critics of the Nitish Kumar-led government.
Tejaswi, who is the younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, alleged the BJP has never initiated decisive action against the perpetrators responsible for violence in their respective states.
"In Madhya Pradesh, an officer was killed brutally by the sand mafia.
In Vyapam scam, the witnesses were killed one after the other.A JMM leader was killed in Jharkhand.
Such episodes are never tagged as 'jungle raj', but in Bihar they say it is 'jungle raj'.
This is being done just to defame the government because they have been ousted of power (in Bihar) till 2019," he said.
Tejaswi also referred to violence during the quota agitation in Gujarat and Haryana to take potshots at the BJP.
Rocky Yadav, the son of a ruling party legislator Manorama Devi, accused in killing of a teenager in Bihar's Gaya town, was arrested yesterday.
The 30-year-old, who was absconding after the incident, was arrested from Bodh Gaya, about 15 km from Gaya.
Yadav is the son of legislative council member Manorama Devi of the ruling Janata Dal (United).
Yadav allegedly shot dead Aditya Sachdeva, a teenager on Saturday night for overtaking his car on the Bodh Gaya-Gaya road.
The police had earlier on Monday raided the house of Devi and had questioned her to find the whereabouts of her son.
The Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Gaya City Superintendent of Police Awkash Kumar had gone to Manorama Devi's house and after a three-hour long search, questioned her about the whereabouts of his son Rocky Yadav, absconding since the incident in Gaya.
He also said the BJP is advertising the Gaya incident in a way as if it is an extremely rare and first incident
