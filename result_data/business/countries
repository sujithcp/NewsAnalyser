Apropos of 'The climate conundrum' (ET, Oct 9), Mukul Sanwal rightly suggests that developing countries should lead in setting the agenda for global technological cooperation.
We need global technological breakthroughs in energy systems, automobiles, building design, urban planning, food systems, etc., to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries.
This can help hasten worldwide transition to sustainable technologies and the creation of millions of jobs, benefiting the rich and developing countries alike.
