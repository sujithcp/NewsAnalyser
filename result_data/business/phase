It's been 12 years since the company has been formally allotted 3,475 acres but is yet to get full possession
Twelve years after being formally allotted 3,475 acres at Kalinganagar in this state's Jajpur district to set up a six million tonnes (mt) a year integrated steel plant, Tata Steel is yet to get possession of the full area.
It is in possession of 2,100 acres, on which the company recently operationalised a three mt capacity, the first phase.
The rest of the land continues to be occupied by local villagers, agitating against the project since 2004.
T V Narendran, managing director, during a trip to the city last year, had said work on the second phase for another three mt would be taken up immediately after completion of the first phase.
The latter was commissioned in November 2015 but there is no sign of commencing work on the second phase.
The first phase saw the building of a sinter plant, coke oven, blast furnace, steel melting shop (SMS) and hot strip mill (HSM).
Except for common facilities like SMS and HSM, the other units need to be replicated in the second phase, apart from construction of another cold rolling mill.
Also, there has been little progress on land acquisition and relocation of displaced persons in the past four years.
After an initial setback following the killing of 14 tribals in police firing in 2006, the company had taken possession of 2,100 acres and rehabilitated 1,000 of the 1,234 families identified for displacement by the end of 2011.
After that, the process has slackened, said a district official.
This is because the remaining area mainly constitutes the villages which served as the epicentre of resistance against the project and also home to the agitation leaders, he said.
"It is taking time to convince these people to vacate their villages," he explained.
A company spokesperson, in a written reply to queries, said:"We have settled 1,113 families and our teams are in discussion with the balance 121 families (for relocation and resettlement)...We will be making our best efforts to settle families affected by our expansion program in phase-II."
Sources said beside the land issues, the current downturn in the steel market and developments on Tata Steel's business in Britian (which it's trying to sell, after years of big losses) are likely to delay the progress on the Kalinganagar expansion.
