Two financial professionals accused of making 7.4 million pounds ($10.7 million) with three others on confidential information about six stocks have been found guilty by a London court, with the other men acquitted.
Here's what you need to know about them.
Andrew Hind, Accountant
Age: 56, Verdict: Guilty
Hind graduated with a first-class degree from Manchester University before becoming an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Hind was described throughout the trial as "odd."
The jury was told he hoarded food at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis in case of civil unrest, building an "armoury" of spears, hockey sticks and baseball bats to protect the supplies.
According to the prosecution, Hind was the middleman passing information from Dodgson and Harrison to Parvizi and Anderson.
He was behind a number of covert devices employed by the group: encrypted memory sticks, nicknames and pay-as-you-go phones.
Andrew Harrison, Former Panmure Gordon corporate broker
Age: 46, Verdict: Acquitted
A New Zealand native, Harrison started his career as a lawyer in Auckland before moving into banking.
He worked at UBS, Panmure Gordon & co, Lloyds Banking Group Plc, and Altium Capital Ltd. Harrison was only linked to one of the six trades in which prosecutors said the group illegally shared information - Internet security company nCipher Plc.
He was introduced to Hind by Dodgson.
The prosecution said Harrison tipped off Hind to the nCipher takeover in 2008, which Panmure was advising on.
Martyn Dodgson, Former Deutsche Bank MD
Age: 44, Verdict: Guilty
Well-spoken and polite, Dodgson went to university in Lancaster, graduating with a first-class degree in economics.
He has worked at several prestigious firms including: Lehman Brothers Holdings and Deutsche Bank.
According to the prosecution, while he was at Lehman, Dodgson fed tips on the takeovers of Scottish & Newcastle Ltd. and mortgage provider Paragon Group of Companies Plc to Hind, who passed them to Parvizi and Anderson to trade on.
Iraj Parvizi, Day Trader
Age: 50, Verdict: Acquitted
Parvizi is a professional gambler.
He moved to England at the age of 12 from West Asia, where his father was a diplomat before the Iranian revolution.
He moves between residences in Dubai, Los Angeles and Spain.The FCA said Parvizi knew Hind's "man" worked at a bank and was passing confidential information based on a taped conversation the regulator got from a bug planted in Anderson's office.
Parvizi said he was lying on the tape.
Ben Anderson, Day Trader
Age: 71, Verdict: Acquitted
Anderson grew up in Glasgow and studied economics at the University of Dundee.
Anderson, like Parvizi, had a network of contacts he traded on behalf of and multiple accounts in family and friends' names.
Prosecutors claim Anderson knew that Hind was giving them inside information, supported by the taped conversation with Parvizi.
