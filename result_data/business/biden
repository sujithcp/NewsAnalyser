Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she arrives at a campaign stop at Jackie O's Production Brewery and Tap Room in Athens, Ohio, Tuesday, May 3, 2016 AP/PTI
US Vice President Joe Biden has said Hillary Clinton would emerge as the Democratic party's presidential nominee and eventually replace Barack Obama at the White House next January.
"I feel confident that Hillary will be the nominee, and I feel confident she'll be the next president," Biden told ABC 's 'Good Morning America' television show in an interview, the excerpts of which were release yesterday.
The full interview would be broadcast today.
Biden's remarks hold significance given that the Democratic presidential primary is still underway.
Such a comment from him is considered to be a step below endorsement by the White House.
Last year, Biden had announced that he will not run for US presidency.
Clinton, 68, has a distinct advantage over her sole primary rival Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, from Vermont.
