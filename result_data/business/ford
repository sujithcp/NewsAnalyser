According to the proposal, Ford Motor will be a co-developer in the sector specific SEZ of information technology/information technology enabled service (IT/ITES) at Sholinganallur village in Tamil Nadu, developed by Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT).
The company is expected to take up IT/ITES services related to automotive finance and allied sectors including setting up of the centre.
The centre will host operations of Ford Global Business Services in areas of IT, product engineering, finance and accounting and data Analytics.
It has set up its first manufacturing unit at Chennai spread across 300 acres.
It has an installed annual capacity to produce 200,000 vehicles and 340,000 engines.

Vehicles and engines made at these two plants are exported to as many as 50 countries across the globe.
While industry sources said the investment would be around Rs 2,500 crore, Ford's spokesperson refused to share details
