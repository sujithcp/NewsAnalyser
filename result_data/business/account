To make life easier for the investors, the government has come up with new rules for those investing in Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) for their daughter’s future.
They have taken into account the possible hurdles an investor could face after enrolling in the scheme and have clarified on them.
According to the new rules, for example, the account can be closed on compassionate grounds once it’s in operation for five years.
If the account holder, the girl child, needs medical support in life-threatening disease or the guardian dies, the account can be prematurely closed.
In this case the person will get the money with full interest rate.
If the account is prematurely closed for any other reason, then the deposit will be eligible only for the interest rate prescribed for the Post Office Savings Bank.
“The changes made to the scheme not only ensures procedural efficiencies but also consider financial security of the girl child,” says Divya Baweja, partner at Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
The scheme was started for social impact in 2014 and the changes that are made take into account investors from different economic background, according to Archit Gupta, CEO and founder of ClearTax.in.
He points out that as per the new rules, a girl child would be eligible for an SSY account if she is resident Indian citizen at the time of account opening and remains so until maturity or closure of account.
“That means non-resident Indian girl children cannot benefit from SSY accounts.
Earlier rules were silent on this aspect,” says Gupta.
When the girl child becomes non-resident or non-citizen, the guardian needs to intimate the bank within one month.
There will be no interest paid from the date residential status changes and the account shall be considered as closed.
The period of deposit in this account has also been increased by one year.
A person can now deposit money in SSY account for 15 years from the date of opening the account.
Baweja says that the account now matures after 21 years.
And the account holder can also prematurely close it if she is about to marry and is 18 or above.
Earlier, there was no such need for premature withdrawal before marriage.
Earlier, if the guardian had put in more than Rs 1.5 lakh during a financial year in the account, she would be devoid of availing herself of tax money on the money invested above Rs 1.5 lakh.
There was no clarity if the additional fund would get the applicable interest rates.
According to the new rules, a person can only put Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year.
If the person adds additional funds, there will be no interest paid on the money and the guardian can withdraw it any time.
Other than these major changes, there are also minor procedural changes that the government has brought in, which found no mention in the earlier rules.
Now, an account can also be open for an adopted girl child.
The guardian also needs to deposit minimum Rs 1,000 a year to keep the account operational.
If the condition is not met, the account will be treated as ‘account in default’ and can be regularised on payment of Rs 50 penalty for each year.
If the individual fails to regularise the account, on maturity, the account holder will only get Post Office Savings Bank interest rate.
The government has also clarified that payment for the account can also be made through electronic mode.
Earlier, the rules stated that payment were allowed only through cash and cheque.
SSY can now be transferred from a bank to post office and vice versa.
The guardian or the account holder has to furnish proof of shifting of residence.
Even if you are not relocating, you can transfer the account by paying a fee of Rs 100 to the post or to the bank to which the transfer is being made.
The finance ministry has also clarified on many other possible hurdles investors could face after enrolling in the scheme
