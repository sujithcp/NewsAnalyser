The number of right to information (RTI) applications has come down to around 7.55 lakh in 2014-15 from over 8.34 lakh a year before as departments and ministries are putting more information in public domain on their own, government said on Thursday.
"As per the Annual Report of Central Information Commissioner (CIC) for 2014-15, a total of 7,55,247 RTI applications were received by reporting public authorities as against 8,34,183 applications in 2013-14, registering a decline of 78,936 RTI applications," Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh said in Rajya Sabha during the Question Hour.
Congress member Rajni Patil asked the minister whether incidents like murder of RTI activists were responsible for the decline in the number of applications.
He also said the number of RTI applications pending with public authorities as on April 1, 2013 was 1,28,447 compared to 89,785 as on April, 2014 which also showed a decline of 30.09 percent over the previous year.
Singh replied that the "primary reason" for this trend was that "more departments are putting information in public domain suo motu".
Citing the example of Department of Personnel and Training which he heads, the minister said the orders related to transfer of officers are put on the website even before it reaches the concerned official.
