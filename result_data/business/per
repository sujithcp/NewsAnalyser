Expressing hope that the worst phase for Indian exports is over, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said overseas shipments may now enter the positive territory.
It seems the declining trend in exports has been tapering off in recent months.
The minister also said that there is an important need to focus on standards of the products and services exported by traders.
If Indian exports were to improve despite a shining rupee, that indeed would mark a big development for the economy .
Here's a look at the six triggers that may impact the markets today
Panel to help PSU banks negotiate bad loans mulled : India is considering setting up an independent panel to help state-owned banks negotiate settlements with big businesses on bad loans, in order to shield bankers from a populist backlash they say is hobbling efforts to clean up their balance sheets.
The proposal, being examined by the government and in its early stages, would give the panel power to define the "haircut" a bank should face on a loan gone sour, protecting bankers from critics who want failed Indian firms to pay back in full, two finance ministry and two central bank officials said.
A lifeline for banking stocks?
Medium-term stock returns set to rise, says Morgan Stanley: The worst seems to be over for India's corporate debt crisis, said Morgan Stanley , a global financial services firm, as companies are reporting positive free cash flow (FCF) for only the second time in two decades.
The investment firm said medium-term equity returns are expected to rise, while company-specific problems may provide portfolio opportunities for investors.
Increased chances of La Nina good for farm GDP , sector stocks: International weather forecasters have joined the Indian weatherman to come out with encouraging commentary on monsoon predictions -that are supporting stocks focused on rural themes.
Weather forecasters, from Japan to the US, Australia to Indonesia, have predicted a higher possibility of La Nina -a weather phenomenon that could result in more rainfall in Asia and Australia.
Over the past four weeks, weather forecasting agencies in Australia and the US have issued a 'La Nina watch' for 2016.
A La Nina watch means a 50% chance of the particular weather pattern developing in 2016, which is about twice the average likelihood.
Order flow very healthy in urban infra: if road contracts were the biggest beneficiaries of government spending in 2015-16, urban infrastructure encompassing housing, schools, hospitals and waste management, among others also scaled.
A recent report by Emkay Global Financial Services says projects awarded in segments such as water supply and housing rose 51-64 per cent over a year before in 2015-16.
Compared to the traction seen in roadways contracts where orders worth nearly Rs 50,000 crore were awarded (up 108 per cent year-on-year), order awards in urban infra (Rs 43,000 crore) were close behind.
Going by the healthy order flows, ignoring this space might not be wise.
Services growth softens in April: India's services sector slackened its pace in April owing to slower growth in new orders, mirroring the weak performance of manufacturing sector.

The services PMI had experienced a 19-month high of 54.3 in January, which was again achieved in March.
