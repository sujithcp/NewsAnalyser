You swipe your card for Rs 15,000 and immediately get an SMS alert from your bank asking if you want to convert the transaction into an Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI).
While it is useful for someone who is unable to pay off the entire amount on the due date, it comes with certain conditions.
You will be charged interest and your credit limit will be reduced to the extent of the transaction till you pay it off.
Banks encourage customers to opt for EMI in order to prevent default on credit cards.
This is also a way for them to earn interest income.
But opt for it only if you can’t afford to pay off your credit card dues at one go, says Naveen Kukreja, Co-founder & CEO of Paisabazaar.com, an online aggregator for financial products.
The two most important things that cardholders should keep in mind are the tenure and the rate of interest, says Vijay Jasuja, CEO, SBI Cards.
The rate of interest will vary from customer-to-customer and from bank to bank.
Even for the same customer it may vary.
“The rate of interest is not constant.
For instance, bank may offer you 14% in one month but you may choose not to opt for the EMI.
Two months later when you want to opt for EMI the rate may be higher,’’ he says.
The advantage of the EMI option is that you can save on the interest cost on the unpaid amount.
If you pay the minimum amount due and revolve the rest, the interest on the remaining amount is very high, around 30-40%.
“The rates on EMI option are usually slightly higher than personal loans.
Besides it is convenient as there is no documentation required like it is for a personal loan,’’ Jasuja says.
The rates for EMI vary between 12-20% and the tenures range between three months and in some cases two or three years.
Longer the tenure higher is the interest rate.
“It is advisable to go for the shortest possible tenure, but depends on the repayment capacity of the customer,’’ says Kukreja.
Another advantage of the EMI option is that often deals and promotions are funded by manufacturers that can further lower the interest rate, says Deepak Chandnani, CEO of Worldline South Asia and Middle East.
“Each bank decides a minimum amount to convert into EMI.
This varies from bank to bank and is usually between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000.
In case of an online transaction, the merchant ties up directly with issuing banks or acquiring banks to offer the EMI facility,’’ he says.
This is how the EMI option works.
Assuming your credit limit is Rs 50,000 and you make a transaction of Rs 15,000, which you convert into EMI.
You will have to pay an instalment every month, which will include the interest rate.
In your next billing cycle, your credit limit will be Rs 35,000.
Let us assume your EMI is Rs 3,000 for a period of six months.
After the first instalment, your credit limit will become Rs 38,000 and gradually it will get restored.
Any other transaction has to be paid in full.
If you exceed your reduced credit limit some banks may allow the transaction to go through, while some may not.
If the bank allows you to exceed the limit, it will levy a charge for the ‘over-limit account’.
There is also an option where your EMI is over and above the credit limit.
In this case the credit limit will not reduce.
But the bank will offer it only a case-to-case basis,
depending your repayment history, says Jasuja.
“The EMI option is available on all kinds of cards, but the bank will offer it only if the cardholder has a good track record,’’ he says.
And if you are unable to repay the EMI, then the normal credit card interest rate will apply from the due date, plus a repayment charge, points out Kukreja.
Keep in mind interest rate, tenure and charges if you exceed the credit card limit
