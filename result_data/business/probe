With government facing flak over delay in arresting the culprits in the brutal rape and murder of a Dalit woman, State Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala today said he was monitoring the case on an hourly basis and asserted that they would be brought to justice at the earliest.
"It is a serious case.
It is a time taking investigation.
Scientific evidences are required.
There are no lapses and efforts are being done to nab the real culprits through a scientific probe," he told a meet-the-press programme, organised by the Ernakulam Press Club.
When asked about alleged lapses from the side of local police in the initial stage of investigation and allegations that the post-mortem of the woman was performed by PG students at Alappuzha Medical College, he said, "All such things are being examined by the Special Investigation Team which is conducting a transparent probe into it."
On Chief Investigating officer Deputy SP Anil Kumar being removed and A B Jijimon appointed to head the probe team, Chennithala said the shake up was done as Jijimon has a better understanding of the area where the crime was committed.
Police said Anil Kumar would continue in the probe team, which is under supervision of ADGP Padmakumar and IG Ernakulam, Mahipal Yadav.
Chennithala declined to divulge investigation details with the media, citing that it would affect the progress of the ongoing probe.
Asked if a crime branch probe will be ordered into the incident, he said, "Let police investigation reach a stage and we can think about a crime branch probe in the next phase, if it is required."
Chennithala, who faced protest from DYFI activists at Perumbavoor and Kollam for failure in arresting the culprits, attacked opposition for "politicising" the murder.
The woman, a law student who hailed from a poor family, was allegedly subjected to rape and brutal assault using sharp edged weapons before being murdered at her house at nearby Perumbavoor in Ernakulam disrict on April 28.
He further said that he was monitoring the case on an hourly basis
