The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has moved a step closer to putting in place a democratically-elected national federation before the Rio Olympics.
After receiving a no-objection certificate from the Government, the BFI has got itself registered under the Societies Act.
The registration is an essential prerequisite for a body to be recognised as a national federation.
“The registration process is now complete and the BFI is a now a duly registered society in Mumbai,” said a statement from the ad-hoc committee appointed by the International Boxing Association (AIBA).
In the next few days the BFI is hoping to complete other requirements, including the opening of a bank account, before going ahead with the elections.
“We, as BFI, have already covered 90 per cent of the distance and now the crucial last lap remains wherein we need to show more unity and more cooperation in order to reach our goal.
“As per the BFI Constitution we require 21 days notice and as per AIBA statutes a month’s time period is needed for AIBA to screen the nominations as well.
“Accordingly, a new date is being worked out as election before May 14 is not possible now,” said AIBA ad-hoc panel chairman Kishen Narsi.
