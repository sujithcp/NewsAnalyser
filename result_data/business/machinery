Unless adequately addressed, the concerns about smooth availability of machinery spares parts by several key industries like textiles, plastics processing, printing, automobiles and pneumatics and others will become worse going forward, especially at a time when the mantra is Make in India."
As it is new initiative, the company is aiming to strengthen its base by associating maximum suppliers across India.

The platform offering more than 10,000 different products of engineering goods in price range of Rs 200 to Rs 150,000.
