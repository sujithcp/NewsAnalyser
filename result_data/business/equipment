Equipment solution provider Srei Equipment Finance Limited (SEFL) has come up with a first-of-its-kind scheme whereby construction equipment owners can exchange their old equipment to buy new ones and avail attractive financing solutions.
"Pre-owned construction equipment market in India is largely unorganised and our initiative helps buyers acquire used equipment at a fair value by directly interacting with the sellers.We believe it is a win-win situation for all customer segments, OEMs and Asset Finance Solution providers, like ours", Devendra Kumar Vyas, CEO of SEFL said in a statement.
Equipment owners are able to replace their existing equipment with those having higher productivity, better technology and improved fuel efficiency.
In this endeavour, the company had recently organised a programme in Jaipur in Rajasthan to showcase the benefits of the scheme.
"This is a splendid initiative.
The platform will help equipment owners like us in replacing our existing equipment with new ones without any hassles and with easy financial schemes", Khangar Singh Rajpurohit a contractor from Jodhpur said.
