LONDON Central banks across emerging market nations need to find ways to coordinate strategies during times of crisis, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
"Already you see a number of emerging markets intervening to help their neighbours," Rajan said during a speech in London, noting India had liquidity lines open for some of its neighbours.
"In the absence of the right kind of instruments on a global level, people need to work with each other and we need to figure out how to make this more part of the global structure," he added.
