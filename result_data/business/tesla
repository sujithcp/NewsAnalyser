Tesla just took the most ambitious automotive production timeline since the Ford Model T and moved it up two years.
The company now plans to produce 500,000 electric cars every year starting in 2018.
That's 10 times the number of vehicles it produced in 2015, and enough to ensure that all 400,000 customers who put down a $1,000 deposit on the forthcoming Model 3 will qualify for a significant US subsidy.
Talk about doubling down-even the original 2020 goal was considered a long shot by Wall Street.
This new target would pledge the carmaker to a faster production growth rate than Ford Motor Co. managed in the early 1900s.
That's when Henry Ford pioneered the production line with the Model T, the first mass-market combustion-driven car.
GROUND BREAKING Tesla to produce 500,000 electric cars each year from 2018 That will be 10 times the number of vehicles it produced in 2015 All 400,000 customers who deposited $1,000 on the upcoming Model 3 will get a significant subsidy BNEF tracked 234,000 electric car sales worldwide last year, of which Tesla made up a fifth of the market That subsidy will drop by half shortly after the company reaches 200,000 sales in the US US buyers already waiting in line will benefit from a federal tax break currently valued at $7,500
A century later, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wants the Model 3 to be its electric grandchild.
He's now aiming for close to a million sales by 2020.
"My desk is at the end of the production line," Musk said in an earnings conference call on Wednesday.
"The whole team is super-focused."
Musk's enthusiasm aside, sceptics say his planned ramp-up is unattainable in the modern era.
If Tesla can succeed-and even Musk admits that it's a tough goal-it would be a tectonic shift for the global electric-vehicle market, just like the Model T was for the combustion engine.
Here's a rough outline of what Tesla must do over the next two years to reach its new goal:
"It would reshape the entire global car industry," said Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Salim Morsy.
"But a lot of things have to go right, and they have to go right on the extremes."
BNEF tracked 234,000 electric car sales worldwide last year, of which Tesla made up a fifth of the market, Morsy said.
For Tesla to stay on its new track, it would need to produce more cars next year than the entire global electric-car industry made in 2015.
Tesla's first mass-produced car, the $35,000 Model 3, will need to come to market on schedule, and with great momentum, in late 2017.
Telsa's battery factory in Nevada must flourish, costs must come down, and car-making capacity must scale up at an astonishing rate.
For context: Tesla has never managed to hit one of Musk's timelines for a new product launch.
Not once.
But if Tesla can do it this time, US buyers already waiting in line will benefit from a federal tax break currently valued at $7,500.
That subsidy will drop by half shortly after the company reaches 200,000 sales in the US, which would take place in 2018, assuming a 50 per cent compound annual growth rate.
The more cars Tesla can sell that year, the more buyers will benefit from the subsidy.
If Tesla ramps up in 2017, it could begin to drop sooner, but late-2018 buyers would still get a few thousand dollars.
