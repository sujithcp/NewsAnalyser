The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has constituted a three-member committee to prepare a policy framework for taxi and other transport operators.
The committee will be headed by Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and have Joint Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and Delhi Transport Commissioner as its members.
A group of taxi and other transport operators had met Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways and Shipping on Monday, apprising him of the situation that has emerged following Supreme Court’s order of December 15, 2015 and directions of EPCA dated April 29, 2016 banning diesel taxis in the NCR, and the various problems they are facing as a result of the ban.
"The three-member committee will look into these issues and come up with appropriate policy recommendations to address the same in a time bound manner," said a ministry press release today.
The taxi operators in the NCR had taken to streets last week to protest ban on diesel taxis after which both the Centre and the Delhi government sought a review of the Supreme Court decision.
The Delhi government has even proposed a phased ban on non-CNG taxis.
The Union government had last year come up with an advisory for “licensing, compliance and liability of on-demand information technology based transportation aggregator”.
It said cab aggregators should obtain licence under section 93 of MV Act, 1988 which provides for licensing of agents that solicit customers for public service vehicles.
Last month Karnataka notified On-demand Transportation Taxi Aggregators Rules under the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, 1988 not just to regulate companies like Ola and Uber.
The aggregators, unlike conventional taxi services, do not own vehicles but provide an online market place to drivers and customers.
