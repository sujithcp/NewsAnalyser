Amid the ongoing political crisis in Nepal, Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli is scheduled to address the Legislature-Parliament meet at 3 pm on Thursday.
During the meet, Oli will be addressing on the recent political development that had set off after Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of coalition partner Unified Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist (UCPN-M), issued a statement urging all political parties to support the formation of a new government under his leadership, reports Kathmandu Post.
Earlier in the day, a meeting of the Council of Ministers was postponed after a minister affiliated with the UCPN (M) did not show up for the Cabinet meeting.
Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Bhim Rawal refused to acknowledge the boycott, citing it was due to the internal homework and discussions of the party.
"They have internal discussion of the party to attend.
So they did not come," said Rawal.
Oli's seven-month-old government faces an imminent exit as other political parties have joined hands with a clear majority in the House.
Nepali Congress, the main opposition party, joined hands with the second-largest ruling coalition partner Unified CPN-Maoist and agitating Madhesi-based parties to topple Oli-led government yesterday.
