The reports suggested that Khattar had requested Union minister V K Singh to make efforts to get the road renamed after the 16th century Mewar ruler, who is known for his fight against the Mughals.
NEW DELHI: Urban Development Ministry has "not received" any proposal for renaming Akbar Road to Maharana Pratap Road in the heart of the national capital.
The remark comes in the wake of reports that the ministry has "rejected" the "proposal" of Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar, seeking rechristening of Akbar Road in Lutyens' Delhi , where Congress' headquarters is also situated.
"Urban Development Ministry has not recieved any suggestion in this regard," a source said.
The reports suggested that Khattar had requested Union minister V K Singh to make efforts to get the road renamed after the 16th century Mewar ruler, who is known for his fight against the Mughals.
Last year, the government had renamed Aurangzeb Road in the Lutyens' Bunglow Zone after former President late A P J Abdul Kalam , despite opposition from various quarters.
