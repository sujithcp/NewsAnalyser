Apropos A K Bhattacharya's article, "Towards a new cooking gas regime", I agree that the criterion for granting subsidy to the rich should be determined on the basis of identifiable physical assets.
The easiest way to do this is on the basis of car ownership.
If a person can afford to maintain a car, his/her family should be in no need of a cooking gas subsidy.
As the database of car owners is in existence, it should not be difficult to implement the proposal.
Further, at the time of new car purchases, owners should be asked to produce a certificate from the gas agencies cancelling their gas subsidy.
