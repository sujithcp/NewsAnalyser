Tata Steel has achieved a major breakthrough in its industrial park being developed at Gopalpur in south Odisha with the project getting the status of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ).
The SEZ notification promises to draw firm investments to the Gopalpur project where the steel company is the anchor tenant.
"Yes, it (the Gopalpur industrial park) is notified.
Recently, we have got the SEZ notification.
A lot of people are interested to invest in the project.
They were waiting for the notification", said T V Narendran, managing director, Tata Steel said on the sidelines of a summit on 'Sustainable Mining' organised here by Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (Fimi).
The SEZ notification is for 500 hectares (or 1,235 acres).
The Gopalpur multi-product SEZ has the potential to attract investments of the order of Rs 15,000 crore.
Investments are expected to flow in areas like defence, electronics, LEDs (light emitting diodes) and solar cells.
"We have already got an investment for the Gopalpur project.
To draw investors, roadshows have been held in China, Singapore, Israel and Dubai.
Our ferro alloys plant at the site is almost ready where we are investing Rs 500-600 crore", Narendran said.
On the Kalinganagar steel project, he said, "Different components of the steel plant have been commissioned.
Production has started from the blast furnace and SMS (Steel Melting Shop).
We would like to reach the capacity (of three million tonne) as quickly as possible though I cannot comment on the timeline now."
Tata Steel has roped in Ernst & Young as the consultant for the Gopalpur SEZ project while Singapore-based Jurong has been engaged for designing the master plan.
"Jurong has given the design for the SEZ while we have engaged a Delhi-based company to submit the cost estimates for external infrastructure development in the SEZ area.
Our ferro alloys plant of 55,000 tonne per annum capacity is nearing completion and it is expected to be commissioned by July this year", said Arun Misra, vice president, Gopalpur project and managing director, Tata Steel SEZ.
Mumbai-based Sure Safety Solutions Ltd in collaboration with UK's Megitt Defence has started operations of the aerial target manufacturing facility at the Gopalpur park.
The industrial park at Gopalpur is spread over an area of 2952 acres.
Of this, 1235 acres of land has been registered in the name of Tata Steel.
