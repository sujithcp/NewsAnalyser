The deal will help Airtel deleverage through debt reduction and reduced capital expenditure, though the size was not disclosed.
Bharti has 14,000 towers in Africa approximately, of which it has divested 8,300 for nearly $1.7 billion (Rs 11,318 crore).
The divestment also includes towers currently under construction in the DRC, according to the company.
Airtel will have full access to towers from HTA under a long-term lease contract.

The agreement is subject to statutory and regulatory approvals.
Christian De Faria, executive chairman, Bharti Airtel International Netherlands (BAIN), said, “The agreement is in line with our stated philosophy of divesting passive infrastructure and promoting sharing of towers to enhance operational efficiencies that will further the growth of telecom services.
Airtel remains committed to DRC and will continue to invest in its operations and serve customers with world-class services.”
In March this year, BAIN, the subsidiary of Airtel had entered into an agreement with American Tower Corporation (ATC), through its subsidiary, Airtel Tanzania, to sell 1,350 towers in the latter country.
Analysts estimate the deal size to be $180 million.
ATC would acquire around 100 additional sites.
Airtel will be anchor tenant on the portfolio under a lease, with a 10-year initial term.
Tanzania is the ninth country where it has undertaken divestment of passive infrastructure.
In all, Bharti is expected to raise around $2 billion from the sale of tower assets alone.
