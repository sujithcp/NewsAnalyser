Allergan Plc (AGN.N), whose $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) fell apart last month, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, led by strong sales of wrinkle treatment Botox and eye drug Restasis.
Allergan, known as Actavis Inc until it bought Botox-maker Allergan Inc last year and took on its name, also said that its board had authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $10 billion.
The buyback follows Allergan's agreement to sell its generic drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.N) for $40.5 billion.
That deal is expected to close in June.
The company's shares were up slightly in premarket trading.
Up to Monday's close of $213.71, Allergan's shares had fallen about 23 percent since Pfizer scrapped the merger, which would have been the biggest-ever in the pharmaceutical sector.
The deal collapsed after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversions, under which American companies move their domicile overseas to cut taxes.
Ireland-based Allegan said revenue in its U.S. brands business, which includes Botox and Restasis, rose 27.3 percent to $2.30 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.
The unit accounts for about 60 percent of the company's total revenue.
Allergan reported net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a loss of $535.2 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $3.04 per share, slightly above the average analysts' estimate of $3.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue rose 48 percent to about $3.80 billion, short of the average estimate of $3.95 billion.
