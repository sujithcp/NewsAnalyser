The Assam tea industry has, of late, been facing the brunt of climate change in the form of extreme weather conditions.
Either drought like conditions or high intensity rainfall have been playing spoilsport with the state’s tea industry.
The industry, which had a good start this year with “above normal” crop harvest in March, saw a dip in production the very next month due to excessive rainfall.
Industry sources say the dip in output in April could be as high as 30-35 per cent and production of first flush (generally till April or mid-May) is likely to be at 34 million kg as against the 44 million kg in 2015.
Many tea gardens in the Brahmaputra valley battled the problem of water logging due to high intensity rainfall.
Tea crop loss for short duration of time every year due to extreme weather conditions has become a normal trend for the tea industry of late.
In 2012 again, excessive rainfall, coupled with pest attacks, made the going tough for the state’s tea industry.
Studies conclusively indicate that Assam, and particularly the Brahmaputra valley, has been witnessing “significant” changes in rainfall pattern and temperature in recent years.
A study on climate change, done by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Guwahati, found that the state has been witnessing long rainless spells or high intensity rainfall of short duration in recent years.
The study conducted by Professor Arup Kumar Sarma, found that water logging and soil erosion in tea gardens were the two major challenges of “alarming” nature that ‘short duration and high intensity’ rainfall was posing to the state’s tea industry.
“A significant variation in total yearly rainfall with time has been seen in almost all districts (of Assam).
Such variation in rainfall will definitely have some impact on various sectors of economy,” found the study.
An earlier study conducted by the Tocklai Experimental Station (TES) of Tea Research Association (TRA), based in Jorhat in Upper Assam, to gauge the impact of climatic changes on the tea industry too had revealed similar details.
The study had found that the average minimum temperature in Assam had risen by 1 degree Celsius in past 90 years, besides the region losing around 200 mm rainfall because of climatic changes.
Another study by ‘Centre for Environment Social and Policy Research (CESPR), and Rashtriya Gramin Vikas Nidhi (RGVN) in collaboration with Indian Network on Ethics and Climate Change (INECC) found that six districts of Assam—Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Morigaon and Baksa, spread across the Brahmaputra valley have already started experiencing impacts of climate change.
“We in tea industry do not want to talk about climate change and its impact on us; might be due to business considerations.
But it is true that it is affecting us and we have to find remedial measures to tackle it.
However, if one goes by the annual production figures of Assam tea industry, it throws baffling details.
Figures say the production of Assam tea industry is rather on an upswing in recent years.
The tea industry which was struggling to touch the 500 million kg annual production mark till 2010, has been posting annual production figures above 600 million kg since 2013.
The tea industry puts forth the ‘make-up in later months’ theory, which means after the extreme weather phase subsides, production picks up and the industry catches up with the loss.
However, few have a different take as they believe the increase in production of Assam tea industry could be possible due to the recent growth in number of small tea growers.
“It is only because of the growth in the number of small tea growers that we are being able to post bumper production figures these days.
The production graph has been more or less stagnant for large and medium sized tea estates.
Had there been no small tea growers, the production scenario would have been very different,” said an industry insider.
“Tea industry is affected by climate change and there is no denying the fact.
But the changes in weather can bring down the quality of Assam tea,” Sarma said.
However, he added that modernising tea factories and extensive use of technology in factories could help retain Assam tea’s distinct quality.
The IIT study found that Golaghat district, which is often considered as the world’s best tea producing area, has been lately suffering from long spells of drought-like conditions.
Also on the other hand, it often experiences high intensity rainfall, leading to erosion or water logging.
The study also revealed that both maximum and minimum temperature has an increasing trend in Tinsukia, Golaghat and Karbi Anglong districts.
But then, investing more on technology or modernising tea factories would result in increase in cost of production for the already over-burdened Assam tea industry.
With the state’s tea industry often finding itself unhappy with the price realisation, investing heavily in say irrigation facility could be a tough call to take.
Nevertheless, many of the big tea gardens in areas which are often hit by rainless weather condition, said Deka, have of late woken up to the climate change challenge.
They have begun investing on irrigation facilities and in acquiring new technologies for tea factories.
The tea industry has been demanding the state government to come up with an irrigation scheme for it and also partly subsidise it.
“What appeared a distant need some years back has now almost become a necessity for survival for us,” Deka added.
Bidyananda Barkakoty, advisor to North Eastern Tea Association (NETA), said the state government should commission a study to find which irrigation system would be better suited for tea gardens.
However, he said as per preliminary study done by the industry, drip irrigation has been found to be suitable for tea gardens, which is also less expensive.
Sarma, who believes water logging in gardens is a bigger threat than rainless weather condition, said citing a study that around 70 per cent of the tea gardens in Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Darrang, Sonitpur and North Lakhimpur districts were prone to this problem.
Water logging for prolonged period, said Sarma, could damage tea plants or reduce their capacity to produce new leaves.
Also, losing plantation land due to erosion meant lifelong loss of a certain amount of production.
“Tea industry can tackle drought through irrigation or planting more shade trees or by the use technology, but water logging and erosion of plantation land can cost it dear.
It can result in huge losses for gardens,” he added.
With the growth in population, outlet drains and natural streams are being blocked by people, resulting in water logging in tea gardens.
The IIT study found that construction of railway lines or broadening of roads and highways were also adding to the problem of water logging at many places.
Poorly designed culverts and bridges by the railways were resulting in water logging in upstream areas.
“It appears that in many places the culvert and bridges are not put in correct places as a result of which these culverts and bridges cannot carry the required amount of water and the catchment area suffers for water logging condition, said the study.
The study suggested that districts of Karbi Anglong, Golaghat, Jorhat, Udalguri, Darang, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon and part of Kamrup, which receive “very low” post monsoon rainfall and suffer from drought, should go for rain water harvesting during rainy season and use it during drought period through irrigation.
Besides, it also suggested a host of other measures for the tea industry to take up to overcome the challenge of water-logging and erosion posed by climate change.
