The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday made Prime Minister Narendra Modi's college degrees available in the public domain and demanded an apology from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
"DU refuses to show records of prime minister's degree.
Why?
My info — he did not do BA from DU," the AAP chief had said.
The AAP, according to OpIndia.com , had alleged that "a degree obtained by a namesake of him (Modi) has been shown as as his own", which Kejriwal had said was tantamount to outright “cheating”.
According to the report, Kejriwal had told a press conference that he could say with “full responsibility” that DU’s records have no mention of “Narendra Damodardas Modi” and that one “Narendra Kumar Mahavir Prasad Modi” had taken admission in 1975.
Saying that it was unfortunate that a clarification was required on the Prime Minister's qualifications, BJP President Amit Shah, along with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, said Kejriwal had caused embarrassment.
However, the AAP persisted with its allegations that the degrees were not genuine.
The AAP plans to send a team to Delhi University to verify the documents made public by BJP leaders.
According to the document made public by the BJP leaders, the prime minister graduated from the DU as an “external candidate” in 1978.
He had enrolled in the BA (Pass) course in 1974 and passed it in third division four years later.
They also released his BA mark sheets.
AAP leader Ashutosh alleged there were discrepancies in the documents, including how the PM’s name was spelt differently in the BA degree and the mark sheets as ‘Modi’ as well as ‘Mody’.
“In some places, it is Narendra Kumar Damoderdas and in others, Narendra Damoderdas,” he said.
AAP leaders also alleged there were discrepancies in totalling of the marks.
Here is how a Twitter user attempted to counter AAP and Congress' allegations against the documents presented:
AAP, on its official twitter handle, alleged that there was a discrepancy in the prime minister's marksheet and the degree in terms of the year of issue.
However, a Twitter user under the handle of "Raju Das" said in his tweet that the marksheet being cited by AAP was not the final marksheet.
Das claimed that both the final marksheet and the degree were, in fact, from 1978.
AAP leaders were not the only one raising allegations against the documents released by the BJP, Congress leader Digvijay Singh also joined the fray.
Citing a scan of what is purportedly Modi's Gujarat University Masters of Arts degree, Singh claimed in a Facebook post that the date of issue on the degree was March 13, 1978, which was a Sunday.
Singh's assertion was that it was not possible for the degree to have been issued on a Sunday.
Evidently, Singh did not read the very document he had cited carefully.
The degree clearly says that it was issued on the "thirtieth" of that month, a Thursday.
AAP also claimed in a twitter post by its official twitter handle that the roll number on Modi's BA marksheet and degree were different.
However, it seems that AAP has picked the wrong marksheet.
The purported latest marksheet, cited by Raju Das in his twitter post clearly shows that the both the latest marksheet and degree have the same roll number — roll number 16594.
AAP also claimed on its twitter post that Modi's marks didn't add up.
Citing Modi's marksheet from DU, AAP said that Modi had scored 136 out of 489.
Raju Das seems to have taken exception to that allegation too.
According to Das' tweet, AAP has mistakenly held the paper numbers to be marks and thus arrived at the total marks of 489.
