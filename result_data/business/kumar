A 20-year-old youth was shot dead allegedly by JD(U) MLC Manorama Devi's son Rocky for overtaking his vehicle near police line in Bihar's Gaya district, triggering protests in the area.
Devi's husband Bindeshwari Prasad Yadav alias Bindi Yadav and her security guard Rajesh Kumar were today arrested in connection with the incident.
DIG, Magadh Range, Saurabh Kumar said the incident took place last night as JD(U) MLC's son Rocky Kumar Yadav and his men were travelling in a MUV which intercepted a SUV in which Aditya Kumar Sachdeva (20) was travelling along with four friends from Bodh Gaya to Gaya town.
According to complaint lodged with the police, Rocky Kumar Yadav then shot at Sachdeva apparently to teach him a lesson for overtaking his vehicle.
The DIG said Sachdeva was brought to Anugrah Narayan Medical College and Hospital where the attending doctors declared him as brought dead.
The police officer said following the incident, the JD(U) MLC's husband and security guard were arrested today and 70 rounds of ammunition and a carbine found in her residence in connection with the murder case of Sachdeva.
A manhunt has been launched for the arrest of Rocky Kumar Yadav too, the DIG said.
The youth's murder took political overtones this morning with the Leader of Opposition (LoP) Prem Kumar meeting the family members of the victim to express sorrow and later addressed a large number of people who had blocked road near Mahabir bridge to protest against the murder.
The protesters, led by the Gaya district unit BJP President Anil Swami, raised slogans against the district police demanding arrest of the prime accused in the murder case.
The JD(U) MLC, however, denied her son's role in the murder of Sachdeva and said Rocky Kumar Yadav was innocent.
MLC Manorama Devi's husband Bindeshwari Prasad Yadav had in past been arrested and 6000 rounds of ammunition of a weapon banned for used by public in 2011 recovered from him.
He had also been jailed in a sedition case.
