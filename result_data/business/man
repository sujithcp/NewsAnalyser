Maheish Girri, national secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party and member of Parliament from the East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, has shared a promotional video on Facebook for the government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The advertisement shows a man and a woman, who seem to have decided to go their separate ways, confronting each other.
The man tears up a photograph of them and shoves the pieces into his pocket.
The heartbroken woman, dressed up as if she was in a television soap, says: "Why did you keep them in your pocket?
You could have just thrown them away."
The man replies: "I would have, but there are no dustbins here."
After a pause, he delivers the punchline: "Love can become dirty, but my country can't."
The advertisement has been written and directed by Kuldeep Kaushik and produced by Parul Katyal Films.
