Bajaj Corporation has disappointed the Street with its numbers for the fourth quarter of 2015-16.
Its revenues and net profit for the quarter declined 3% and 1% respectively compared to the same period last year.
A 5% fall in volume, triggered by weak macroeconomic situation, is the main reason for the fall in revenue.
High base effect— sales grew 28% during fourth quarter of 2014-15—is another reason for this year-on-year (y-o-y) decline.Analysts say that things will improve for Bajaj Corporation in 2016-17 because of the expected pickup in consumer sentiment.
After two years of bad monsoon, both IMD and SkyMet have predicted above average monsoon for this season— this will boost rural economy, in particular.
Also, this year's Budget earmarked a high rural spend, and this too will have a positive impact on the rural sector.
Given that around 40% of Bajaj Corporation's sales come from the rural areas, improving rural economy will boost demand for its products.
Analysts expect the company to report double digit volume growth in 2016-17.
Light hair oil is the fastest growing segment within the hair oil market and being the market leader in this segment, Bajaj Corporation continues to benefit from its growth.
The company's light hair oil volume, in the fourth quarter, grew 5% y-o-y.
Long-term potential from this segment is high because it is still in a nascent stage and increasing number of customers are shifting from heavy hair oils to lighter variants.
Though new entrants like Patanjali have shaken up the Ayurvedic hair oil market, they haven't had a similar impact on the light hair oil market.
Bajaj Corporation also enjoys high margins.
Though vegetable oil prices increased in the fourth quarter, lower prices of light liquid paraffin oil—a key ingredient in light hair oils—helped the company improve its margin further, and it recorded the highest margins in the fourth quarter.
Since raw material prices are expected to remain benign in the near future, the company's high margins may last for some more time.
Improved cash flow is helping Bajaj Corporation to maintain its high promotional activities—keep competitors at bay and increase its market share.
With a 60% growth in international revenue in the fourth quarter, the company's international foray is also doing well, and it plans to increase its export share from 4% to 10% in the next 3-4 years.
