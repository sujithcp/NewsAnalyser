Traffic moves at slow pace at ITO, Vikas Marg during the second phase of odd-even scheme, in New Delhi
Taking a jibe at the foreign visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday alleged that the Opposition tried to ensure the failure of odd-even scheme as the initiative was being praised "world over".
He said that the Opposition was worried after Delhi government's scheme was praised by a noted international magazine.
"They had a fear.
After the last odd-even, there were talks about it world over.
Even Fortune magazine discussed about it....(Modi) is going around the globe, but not being praised," he said, without taking Modi's name.
He was speaking at the 'thanks-giving' event to celebrate the odd-even "success".
Kejriwal said that the Opposition tried to ensure the failure of the scheme from day one.
"They tried to orchestrate a strike of auto-drivers but all of them are with the AAP government and their (Opposition) first attempt failed," he said.
"Then their MP (Vijay Goel) said that he will do a 'civil disobedience' movement and violate the odd-even scheme.
Not a single person stood behind him, not even his party men.
They resorted to setting fire in Bhalswa and Gazipur (dumpyards).
All their attempts failed.
Truth cannot be hidden," Kejriwal added.
