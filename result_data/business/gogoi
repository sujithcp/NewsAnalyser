Tarun Gogoi, 79, is the incumbent Chief Minister of Assam, who has been holding the post since May 2001.
Leading the Congress to victory in three consecutive legislative assembly elections, Gogoi has been the longest serving Chief Minister of Assam.
Gogoi is also considered to be one of Assam’s tallest leaders, popular among the people of his state and even more among the people of his constituency.
Gogoi, who will be contesting from Titabor assembly segment, is in fray with BJP MLA Sarbananda Sonowal for the post of Chief Minister during the 2016 state assembly polls.
While the constituency has definitely seen progress under the leadership of Gogoi, part of the population is beginning to complain about the pace in which progress and development has taken place.
Gogoi recently laid the foundation of a Metro line project in Guwahati, with the formation of special purpose vehicle namely Guwahati metro rail corporation limited for implementing the project.
During the 2014 Parliamentary Elections, the Congress won only 3 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Assam, after which Gogoi hinted that he might not be the best option for the party in the 2016 assembly elections.
Gogoi has been pitted against BJP state vice president Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, who is a formidable candidate, mainly due to his performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and his tea tribe identity.
