NEW DELHI: The recent correction in the domestic equity market has dented investor sentiment with options market activity suggesting that traders expect the market's base to shift lower during the ongoing F&O series.
Fresh Put unwinding at strike prices 7,700 (4.10 lakh contracts shed), 7,800 (2.79 lakh contracts shed) and 7,900 (2.41 lakh contracts shed) and Put writing at strike prices 7,500 (2.87 lakh contracts added) and 7,600 (2.76 lakh contracts added) suggest the market base has shifted lower, derivatives data showed.
With Put open interest (OI) of 36.41 lakh contracts, strike price 7,500 now has the third highest Put open interest (OI) which should act as the medium-term support for the market, experts said.
Strike price 7,700 continued to see maximum Put OI at 40.58 lakh contracts, which should act as an immediate support.
On the Call options front, the maximum Call OI has shifted from strike price 8,200 (53.52 lakh contracts) to 8,000 (55.56 lakh contracts), suggesting that the latter will provide strong resistance to the market during the ongoing F&O series.
Fresh Call writing was seen at strike prices 7,800 (8.69 lakh contracts added), 8,000 (6.15 lakh contracts added) and 8,100 (9.22 lakh contracts added).
"On the options front, maximum Call OI stood at strike price 8,000 followed by strike price 8,200, while maximum Put OI stood at strike price 7,700 followed by 7,000.
There was addition of fresh OI at strike price 7,500, which is now turning out to be the medium-term support if supplies continue below the 7,650 level," said Chandan Taparia, Derivatives Analyst - Equity Research, Anand Rathi Financial Services.
India VIX moved up by 3.34 per cent with a decline due to profit booking, which indicates that market participants are shorting on every bounceback, Taparia said.
"The intrinsic value of Call options has decreased, which suggests Call writing at strike prices 8,100, 7,800 and 8,000.
Among Put options, the overall activity has remained subdued," brokerage Angel Broking said in a report.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold positions in index futures to the tune of Rs 1,288 crore with a subsequent fall in open interest, suggesting long unwinding in the last session.
"From the last four sessions, we are witnessing good long unwinding followed by some short formation in index futures.
Currently, the Nifty is hovering in the crucial support zone between 7,650 and 7700.
We advise traders to remain light in this market till we see building of meaningful positions on either direction," Angel Broking said.
