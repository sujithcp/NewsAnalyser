The NDA government may be giving a push to maritime development in the country, but with domestic dredging companies caught between a rock and a hard place, port development is unlikely to pick up.
Banks and financial institutions are not keen to fund shipping as well as shipbuilding related sectors.
The sentiment has touched even dredging companies that not only find it difficult to raise funds from the domestic market but are also compelled to take risks higher-than-needed.
“Banks are simply reluctant to lend on long-term basis.
Funding tenure needs to match dredging contract period, which is usually 15-20 years.
But banks have been approving only medium term funding of three-five years and not beyond that,” said Prasad Patwardhan, chief financial officer at Mercator.
“This is making it difficult for dredging companies to raise funds and tap the ample business opportunities,” he added.
Mercator is mainly into maintenance dredging and currently owns nine dredgers.
Dredging is an excavation activity carried out underwater which is meant to keep waterways navigable.
Capital dredging is usually required for new port facilities, unlike maintenance dredging which is needed to maintain the draft level for ships.
“Since dredging comes under the shipping sector and since banks have burnt their fingers having lent to this industry in the past, dredging companies also land up getting hostile treatment from lenders,” said Senthil Kumar, founder of Chennai-based Swalf Dredging.
“Getting loans sanctioned for dredges is an unending process,” he added.
The company has been trying for the last three years to get Rs 5-crore loan sanctioned for a single dredger it plans to buy.
Bankers' reluctance to lend has compelled domestic dredging companies to look for overseas funding, in turn taking unnecessary currency fluctuation risks in a market that is yet to pick up in a big way.
However, there is potential and growth prospect given the thrust on port-led development by the government.
“Since domestic lenders are not willing to lend for the long-term, we have raised funds from the overseas market in dollars.
Our revenue, however, is in rupees.
This brings about a strain on the balance sheet and also leads to company taking currency fluctuation risks,” said Patwardhan of Mercator.
Besides, domestic dredging businesses are also beleaguered with high operating costs and absence of in-house technology which puts them in a disadvantageous position, compared with foreign dredging companies that offer services 25-35% cheaper than domestic dredging companies.
“Bank interest, taxation and operating costs are far higher for domestic dredging companies, making it difficult to remain competitive in the market,” said Kumar of Swalf Dredging.
Moreover, currently, no Indian shipyard makes dredgers.
Due to this, domestic companies buy equipment from the overseas market at additional costs.
“There is a need for technology transfer in the dredging segment.
To buy dredgers overseas, struggle for the funding of those and then get them imported, which means pay duties, makes it very costly for domestic dredging companies, taking away the level playing field when positioned against a foreign dredger,” said an official with Dharti Dredging & Infrastructure.
Ocean Sparkle, among the private companies, and state-owned Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) are the biggest dredging companies in the domestic market engaged in capital as well as maintenance dredging works.
DCI has been enjoying the most comfortable position in terms of order book, compared to peers and its operating profit too has been on the rise since the last three-four years.
The company's debt-equity ratio is well below one as against a more diversified Mercator which has its debt-equity ratio of 1.33 as on March 31, 2015.
With the funding situation remaining stiff amid cheaper services by foreign players, industry officials said diversification and deployment of dredges overseas instead of the domestic market could help them maintain margins.
“India has huge business opportunity in dredging, but other business factors also need to be friendly.
Dredging in overseas market yields us more than double at present and, hence, dividing dredges between domestic and overseas market can help protect margins,” said Kumar.
The company has dredges deployed in West Asia.
