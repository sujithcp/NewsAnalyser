India's first homegrown messaging app hike messenger will launch a "microapp" for users on the eve of Mother's Day.
Mother's Day falls on May 8 this year.
"This Mother's Day, hike wishes all the mothers and enables hikers to show their love for their moms," hike said in a statement on Saturday.
The company will share the "microapp" with its 100 million users.
With this, hikers can add an image, edit quotes or simply add a message as a token of love to their mothers.
In addition, they can also post customised e-cards and stickers on their timeline or share amongst friends, not only on hike but also on other platforms.
The special feature will be live for two days, the company said.
