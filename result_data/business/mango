Water shortage and unfavourable weather in form of erratic rains has led to a decline in quality of Kesar mango this year in Gujarat.
Along with supply, unfavorable weather conditions during growing period has reduced the sise of the fruit.
According to traders, almost 70-80% mangos in total arrivals are of inferior quality and as a result prices of Kesar mango have been 20% higher for want of quality fruit as against last year.
Currently mango arrivals at Talala Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), biggest Kesar mango market, have been registered at about 20,000 boxes (a box of 10 kg) with prices being quoted anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 500 per box.
Last year at this time Kesar mango traded between Rs 150 and Rs 400 per box.
According to traders, over 50,000 boxes per day also traded in other markets of Gujarat.
The 'Gir Kesar' mango has Geographical Indication (GI) tag, the only other variety of mango in India to get GI registration after the Dussheri mango grown in Uttar Pradesh.
"Fruit sise of Kesar mango is smaller than last year because of unfavorable weather condition during flowering period.
January and March are crucial period for mango and this time, mango plants did not have proper cold which affected the quality", said A R Pathak, vice chancellor of Junagadh Agriculture University.
Farmers did not irrigate the mango plants due to water scarcity at the Kesar mango growing area mainly in Saurashtra because of weak monsoon in 2015.
This has also affected the fruit.
Harsukh Jarsaniya, secretary of Talala APMC said, "Farmers have faced water shortage this year and this has translated into decline in quality.
Almost 70-80% of total arrival at this time is inferior quality.
Talala APMC has registered slow arrivals this year since there has been an uptake in direct buying from farmers."
Prices, according to traders, may not decline much despite increased arrival due to lack of quality fruit.
Ramanik Savaliya, mango trader from Talala Gir said, "Arrival of Kesar mango is going up but as quality is not so good, it will not pressurise the prices in coming days in a big way.
Prices for good quality and big sise fruits will be higher than last year."
Traders are expecting mango arrivals to be at 30,000-35,000 boxes a day at Talala APMC by end of May.
According to traders, 70-80% of the arrivals are of inferior quality, due to which the prices are 20% more than the last year
