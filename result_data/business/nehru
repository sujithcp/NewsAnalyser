Rebutting charges that the references to the first Prime minister, Jawaharlal nehru, were removed from a Class VII textbook, Rajasthan school Education Minister, Vasudev Devnani has said," The revised school syllabus has Jawaharlal Nehru's name at 15 places in different textbooks."
"The government has not omitted Nehru's name from textbooks.
The references to Nehru are available in textbooks of Class 7 (Hindi), Class 9 (Social science) and Class 11 (World History)," the Minister said in a statement.
He also said on tuesday that the Nehru's role in the freedom movement, introducing Panchayati Raj system and Non-Alignment Movement have been given space in the revised textbooks.
"The state government does not favour politics in education.
Syllabus from class 1 to 8 is prepared by the State Institute of Education Research and Training (SIERT) and the Board of Secondary Education prepares the syllabus for classes 9 to 12," Devnani said.
He also quoted that if two or three chapters on Nehru were not included in the syllabus, they would be added in the textbook in supplementary form.
Accusing the state government of omitting references to Nehru from the textbook, the state unit of Congress on tuesday held a demonstration here with Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief, Sachin Pilot, saying that it reflected the mental bankruptcy of the Vasundhara Raje dispensation.
