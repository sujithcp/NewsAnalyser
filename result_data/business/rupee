The rupee depreciated by 6 paise to 66.61 against the US currency in early trade today due to sustained demand for the dollar from importers.
The rupee had closed 13 paise lower at 66.55 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange yesterday.
Dealers attributed the rupee's fall to increased demand for the US currency from importers and dollar's strength against other currencies overseas.
However, a higher opening in the domestic equity market capped the losses.
Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex rose 125.76 points, or 0.50%, to 25,227.49 in early session.
