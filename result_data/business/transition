US President Barack Obama has signed an executive order establishing a team to aid smooth transition process for the new administration as he demits his office next year after eight years in power.
The White House Transition Council, comprising of about a dozen members, is headed by his Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough.
The other officials include Director of National Intelligence and those from the national security, homeland security and counter-terrorism team.
"The peaceful transition of power has long been a hallmark of American democracy.
It is the policy of the United States to undertake all reasonable efforts to ensure that Presidential transitions are well-coordinated and effective, without regard to party affiliation," Obama said in his executive order.
"To facilitate the Presidential transition, including assisting and supporting the transition efforts of the transition teams of eligible candidates, there is established a White House Transition Coordinating Council," Obama said.
Obama's second four-year term ends on January 20, 2017; the day on which his successor would be sworn in.
The US has a term limit on its president.
An individual can't be elected for more than two four-year term.
The election of the new president would be held on November 8, 2016.
While the Republican party would be represented by Donald Trump, the Democratic party is expected to represented for the first time in American history by a woman -- Hillary Clinton.
Even though the new president would be elected on November 8, 2016, he would not be sworn in till January 20, 2017.
In between the president elect would have a transition team that would make the necessary preparation for the takeover.
The White House Transition Coordinating Council would provide guidance to executive departments and agencies and the Federal Transition Coordinator regarding preparations for the Presidential transition, including succession planning and preparation of briefing materials.
"It would also facilitate communication and information sharing between transition representatives of eligible candidates and senior employees in agencies and the Executive Office of the President, including the provision of information relevant to facilitating the personnel aspects of a Presidential transition and such other information that, in the Council's judgement, is useful and appropriate, as long as providing such information is not otherwise prohibited by law," the executive order said.
