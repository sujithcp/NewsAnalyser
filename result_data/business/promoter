Listed companies have seen a decline in promoter and foreign portfolio investor (FPI) holdings during 2015-16.
Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and public shareholding, on the other hand, have scaled up during this period.
According to ICICI Securities, the decline in promoter holding is "an outcome of deleveraging balance sheets by issuing fresh equity, government fund-raising and sale by promoters.
Bulk of the promoter shares were bought by DIIs."
