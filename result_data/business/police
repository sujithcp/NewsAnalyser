"A team of officials from Women's police station visited the state-run protective home where the girl is currently lodged and recorded her statement," a senior official said on condition of anonymity.
The victim had recorded her statement before Child Welfare Committee wherein she had alleged that Monserratte has raped her several times in the past.
The details of the statement were, however, not revealed by the police.
An FIR was registered by Panaji police yesterday in this connection but it was handed over to Women police station last night.
Superintendent of Police (Women police station) Karthik Kashyap told PTI that Monserratte has been booked under section 3,4 of POSCO Act, and relevant sections of the IPC and Goa Children's Act.
Monserratte, who represents St Cruz constituency, was out of town when the case was booked against him yesterday.
He had claimed that the case against him was "politically motivated".
"The girl was working in my showroom and I had dismissed her for misappropriation of funds.
This is a conspiracy against me," he had said.
Monserratte's family members maintained that he is innocent and is being "framed".
"He will depose before the Investigating Agency once he is back in Goa.
He does not want to run away from the law.
He is innocent and is framed," a family member said.
