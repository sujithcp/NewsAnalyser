NEW DELHI: Last September, the aviation ministry announced with much aplomb that controversial businessman Robert Vadra will no longer be exempt from frisking at airports.
It has now turned out that the government claim was only partially true as the Congress chief's son-in-law remains exempt from security checks when flying with wife Priyanka.Till last September, the no-frisking list of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) used to mention Vadra by name and specify that he was exempted from security checks when flying with Special Protection Group (SPG) protectees - which, in his case, meant Sonia, Priyanka and Rahul.
While Vadra's name was dropped from the list last year, the government exempts spouses of the category of people who are on the no checks list, from frisking.
"SPG protectees are at number 30 on the list and Priyanka gets this elite protection cover.
Which means that as her spouse, Vadra will remain exempt from frisking when flying with Priyanka.
But, he will be frisked when he is flying with mom-in-law Sonia, brother-in-law Rahul or when travelling alone," said a senior official.
