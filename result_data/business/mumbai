The two airports are the busiest in the country but also face capacity constraints.
The problem is critical in Mumbai which uses a single runway and does not have extra slots for airlines.
The ministry has decided to form two working groups comprising of airlines, airport operators and Airport Authority of India to examine issues related to capacity, reducing airside congestion and runway occupancy and improving navigation procedures amongst others.
The decision to form the working groups was taken today at a meeting chaired by civil aviation secretary R N Choubey.
Executives of Delhi and Mumbai airports made a presentation highlighting issues and measures being taken to improve air traffic movements.
Mumbai airport handles 45-48 movements a hour and on occasions over 50 movements but with a single runway operation it does not have room to accommodate more flights.
Airport Authority of India officials pointed out that additional air traffic controllers too are being recruited and deputed in Mumbai air traffic control tower which suffers from staff shortage.
The capacity constraint issue at key airports such as Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi is hurting new airlines such as Vistara which is demanding a model for equitable distribution of slots amongst airlines.
"A formula can be reached so that everyone gets a fair share.
New airlines need slots to grow or else there will be a duopoly or monopoly, which is not good for consumers.
Customers will also have an opportunity to experience new services, and fares are kept in check," said Vistara's chief strategy officer Sanjiv Kapoor had said in April.
