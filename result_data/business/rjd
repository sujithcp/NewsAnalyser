BJP members in Lok Sabha today sought imposition of President's Rule in Bihar alleging "jungle-raj" there and indulged in heated exchanges with their RJD and JD(U) counterparts who strongly opposed their demand.
Raking up the issue of deteriorating law and order in the state in the Zero Hour, BJP MP Janaradhan Singh Sigriwal alleged that several ruling alliance legislators or their kins were recently found to have been involved in criminal activities.
Sigriwal referred to incidents of rape and molestations involving RJD-JD(U) legislators and demanded that a central team should visit the state to "see for itself".
He further sought imposition of President's Rule in the state.
Ashwini Kumar Choubey, also a BJP MP from Bihar, narrated a number of incidents to drive home the point that Bihar is witnessing "jungle-raj" and law and order was deteriorating in the state.
The statements led to a war of words between them and Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) and Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U) who protested their demand for central rule.
Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad, expelled RJD MP Rajesh Ranjan said while one dreams to become the next Prime Minister, the other is dreaming to become the Chief Minister.
