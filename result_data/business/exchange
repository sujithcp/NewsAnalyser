Mrugank Paranjape, 49 is taking charge as a Managing Director and CEO of India's largest commodity derivative exchange Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) from Monday, the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya.
His assuming office is good for the exchange as it is getting after two years a full time MD.
The choice of day of joining, however, is just by chance.
After resignation as MD in October 2013 when the exchange was in the midst of a crisis in the promoter's group company, exchange found one MD who had to leave in April 2004 on health grounds after a three months streak.
Since then P K Singhal was steering the exchange when it was passing through troubled waters.
Mrugank has spent over a quarter century in financial services, large part of his career was with Deutsch Bank handling custodian business in Asia and much more.
This IITian and IIM graduate had dealt with technology, has experience of dealing with multiple regulators of several countries and an urge to use his experience now in being instrumental in growing public infrastructure.
"After over a quarter century of experience in managing and developing businesses, one would want to be part of public infrastructure and MCX suits all that is needed as it being an exchange is a front end regulator, it is listed and has to take care of shareholders' interests while growing with those who are dealing with the exchange that is market participants."
But why at a time when it had just seen very challenging phase and now completion is also set to grow?
But Mrugank can saw the things differently which is his strength also.
He said even in troubled times, exchange has protected his market share, efficiently ensure to stay afloat when the regulatory integration is happening and opportunities and competition are set to grow in the exchanges space.
"This is the best time I thought for me to join MCX," he said.
However regarding upcoming competition (when equity exchanges may start commodity derivatives and commodity exchanges could venture in to their strong holds), he is of the view that one needs to pick up battles correctly.
He is equally aware of the opportunities coming up for the exchange when new products and new participants are allowed by the sebi.
Commodity derivatives market is at present in a consolidation phase.
Since almost last three years, ever since transaction tax was imposed lot has happened.
Two exchanges have suspended trading, third one is struggling to stay afloat.
MCX and NCDEX are busy protecting their business and adjusting to new regulatory environment.
Both have seen exits of their promoters or anchor investors.
New opportunities that are being talked about would come with competition.
Whatever this may be for the sector and stakeholders, for Mrugank this is a challenge.
He however is aware that he is from a different industry though also having experience of dealing with multi country regulators.
However equally aware that so far as MCX is concerned, it has maintained market share, it has started getting a fresh talents at senior level and industry veterans like Mr Singhal and other subject experts are there in the exchange to guide him.
And he remembers he has not been able to pursue his college days' hobbies of playing bridge or acting in plays, but if he could get time he would like to do non-business travel and pursue his hobbies again.
His one and half decade successful stint at Deutsche Bank was quite busy as he had to travel a lot.
However he had dealt with several Foreign investors and that could help the exchange as well.
