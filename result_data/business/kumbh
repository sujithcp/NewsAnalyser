With the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) dropping the idea of a "Dharma Sansad" (religious parliament) at the Kumbh in Ujjain, the state government is gearing up for three-day "Vaicharik Kumbh" (May 12-14), which will focus on non-religious topics and give the Ram Temple issue a miss.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to participate in the concluding ceremony of this Vaicharik Kumbh on May 14.
Instead of focusing on the Ram Temple, more than 6,000 delegates from around the world will share their views on "value- based life".
When asked about the Ram Temple, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan evaded a direct reply and said the programme has "value-based life" and the "Krishi Kumbh" on its agenda.
A large number of those associated with the VHP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have visited the venue of the Kumbh, at Ninaura village, which falls on Ujjain-Dewas road.
"This time we are not organising "Dharma Sansad", but we will invite sants, sadhus and visionaries from across the globe to spread the message of "Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam" (The world is a family).
Ayodhya and Ram Temple would not be a part of the agenda," said a VHP source.
Another source in the VHP said: "Religious leaders are expected to meet and discuss issues of various other matters, including the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
But since there would be no "Dharma Sansad", it is difficult to guess what will actually be discussed."
BJP President Amit Shah is also expected to visit Ujjain for the "shahi snan" as well as review preparations at Ninnora.
