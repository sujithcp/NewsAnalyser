When Kerala goes to polls on May 16, there will be many who will be voting for the first time.
But there is one special, first time voter who will be the poll mascot in District Kannur.
100 year old Thressiamma Chacko who lives with her son Johny in Kolakkad in District Kannur, Kerala, will vote for the first time in her life in these assembly polls in Kerala.
Thressiamma received her voter I-card from District collector P Bala Kiran who personally visited her home to hand over her I-card.
"She is very active even at this age and really enthusiastic to exercise her franchise.
She will be an inspiration to all voters to exercise their franchise in the upcoming polls," Bala Kiran told PTI.
Kannur Collector’s Facebook page shared images of the centenarian receiving the card and training from government workers about using the electronic voting machine.
Thressiamma had applied for her voter i-card at Akshaya Centre of the Kerala government.
These centres focus on various facts of e-learning and e-governance.
She says she had never voted in her young age since she had no time to think about polls or voting as she was busy trying to make ends meet for her family.
Well, all we can say is better late than never Amma!
