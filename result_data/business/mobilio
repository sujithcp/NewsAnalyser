The BR-V is based on the Brio's platform, just like the Amaze and the Mobilio.
Although it has an uncanny resemblance with the Mobilio MPV, Honda has provided the BR-V with a distinct identity.
Sharing platforms and parts is common amongst the automakers.
Let us see what the BR-V offers over the Mobilio since it is expected to be costlier than the MPV (check out our BRV price guess).
Unlike the Mobilio, the BR-V comes standard with a six-speed manual gearbox with both the engines.
For the petrol, it will debut a new six-speed transmission, since the City and the Mobilio only come with a five-speed unit with the same 1.5-litre i-VTEC.
Moreover, the diesel’s top speed is not limited to 140 kmph as is the case with the Amaze and the Mobilio.
Besides the new six-speed manual for the petrol, the BR-V also offers an option of CVT (continuously-variable-transmission) with paddle shifters.
It is similar to that of the City and the Jazz petrol automatic.
And just like the rest of the petrol automatics from Honda, the BR-V auto returns a higher certified fuel efficiency of 16 kmpl compared to the manual’s — 15.4 kmpl.
The Mobilio rides 189 mm above the ground while the BR-V offers 210 mm of ground clearance — a healthy 21 mm more!
It also has fatter and bigger tyres compared to the MPV — 195/60 R16 and 185/65 R15 respectively.

Unlike the Mobilio, the BRV comes with LED light guides in the taillamps.
Much like the global Hondas, A reflector strip joins the wrap around tail lights, giving the rear profile a wider appearance.
The new cabin is unquestionably a vital USP it has over the Mobilio.
The latter was criticised for its Brio-derived dashboard.
Honda has completely revamped the dash, which now looks inspired from its premium siblings — the City and the Jazz.
