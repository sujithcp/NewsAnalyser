The presence of foreign matter in food grains is considered as adulteration and the grains could be found unsuitable for human consumption.
NEW DELHI: In a bid to ensure quality of imported pulses, food safety watchdog FSSAI has issued draft quality regulations and fixed the foreign matter limit at a maximum 3 per cent by weight.
"The limits for foreign matter (extraneous matter) shall be maximum 3 per cent by weight, of which the maximum 0.5 per cent by weight may be the inorganic matter and impurities of animal origin," Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) said in a notification.
The food regulator has also invited suggestions from all stakeholders.
Foreign matter means anything extraneous other than food grains.
It can be inorganic matter like metallic pieces, sand, stones and organic matter consisting of husk, straws, weed seeds and other inedible grains.
The presence of foreign matter in food grains is considered as adulteration and the grains could be found unsuitable for human consumption.
The move has come at a time when the government is turning to imports to keep pulse prices in check.
The government has been taking several measures to boost domestic supply as well.
It has created a stock of 50,000 tonnes of pulses and states have been asked to place their demand for timely release of stock for retail distribution.
Imports by both government and private agencies are also expected to boost supply.
As per the Agriculture Ministry's second estimate, pulse production is estimated at 17.33 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), marginally higher than the previous year's 17.15 million tonnes.
India is the world's largest producer of pulses, but its domestic demand outstrips production.
The shortfall is met through imports.
