NEW DELHI: Banking stocks on Dalal Street gave huge thumbs up to the passage of the bankruptcy bill in Parliament on Wednesday.
The bill now awaits the President's ascent before it becomes law.The BSE Bankex, a gauge of banking stocks on the BSE, ended 0.75 per cent higher while the Nifty PSU Bank index climbed 1.23 per cent.
The bankruptcy law is expected to further enhance the ease of doing business in the country, but more importantly it will help decide the fate of several wilful defaulters who own about Rs 1.21 lakh crore to top public sector banks .
"This is one of the most important legislation from the lenders and creditors point of view and provides an exit route for the companies who are unable to compete or survive or are over leveraged," Rajnish Kumar, MD, SBI, told ET Now in an interview.
"Currently, the process for liquidation of any company is very tedious and a long process.
So, because of the bankruptcy code, all that confusion hopefully will be cleared and the priority of payment has been clearly laid out," he added.
Kumar, although, pointed out that more than the law, its efficient implementation would be more critical.
"You can have a very good law but infrastructure is needed to implement it and the law it may be excellent but the execution is what matters.
And execution can only happen when the entire ecosystem is build and various components and pieces will need to be put in place quickly," he said.
