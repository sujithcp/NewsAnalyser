Amid the relentless attack on the PM on the issue, the DU Registrar had earlier this week said that the BA degree was "authentic" and termed as "minor error" the alleged discrepancies in his mark sheets and degree certificate.
NEW DELHI: A day after Aam Aadmi Party accused Delhi University of "authenticating" Prime Minister Narendra Modi's degree due to pressure from the Centre ,the varsity today said it has not been influenced by "any political pressure" and asserted that it is acting in accordance with the law.
Few AAP leaders visited the university yesterday and met Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi over the issue of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's degree.
"The VC told them that RTI cell of the university shall act in accordance with the law but it is incorrect to say that the university is acting under any political pressure," DU Registrar Tarun Das said.
The clarification by DU came a day after an AAP delegation visited the university demanding that they be allowed to examine the records of Modi's BA degree but they had to return empty handed.
AAP leader Sanjay Singh alleged that Tyagi asked them to "understand his position saying there is a lot of pressure on him on the issue".
The AAP has been alleging that the Prime Minister's BA and MA degrees were forged and there were many "glaring discrepancies in them", including in his name and total marks.
Amid the relentless attack on the Prime Minister on the issue, the DU Registrar had earlier this week said that the BA degree was "authentic" and termed as "minor error" the alleged discrepancies in his marksheets and degree certificate.
Das had also said the university had all relevant records of Modi's graduation.
On Monday, BJP had fielded two of its heavyweights -- party president Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley -- to rebut AAP's charges.
They had also released copies of Modi's BA and MA degrees.
