Ashwini retired last year.
While he was working, he saved in deposits, bonds and shares and accumulated what he thought was enough to lead a comfortable retired life.
However, he had to pay a large bill for his recent angioplasty, as he had no medical insurance to fall back on.
Ashwin was taken aback by the unexpected expense as he thought his savings could cover medical costs.
His friends have advised him to get a health insurance policy right away, but he is wondering if it's viable at his age, and worth the cost.
It is important for Ashwini to recognise that with age, healthcare expenses will grow, but regular income will decrease following retirement.
Healthcare costs have been rising at an ever-increasing rate.
Ashwini will definitely want to be able to afford good quality hospital care, medicines, investigative tests, etc.
Knowing that his medical expenses will be covered by health insurance will be a relief.
Ashwini should opt for health insurance plans specifically aimed at senior citizens.
There are only a few such schemes available and they are more expensive than regular health plans.
The reason is obviousâ€”the frequency and severity of illness is more among senior citizens.
Ashwini might discover that health plans for senior citizens come with their own set of limitations, such as stringent medical check-ups, high premiums and exhaustive exclusions.
Hence, while buying a senior citizen mediclaim policy, he must thoroughly research factors like entry and exit age, threshold age for renewal, hospital network, coverage, exclusions, co-pay limit, waiting periods, critical illness cover and domiciliary hospitalisation .
It might still be worth it to have some cover, rather than none at all.
He can shop around to see which policy works for him, and get himself insured before the costs go up due to age or a pre-existing condition.
After his angioplasty, insurers are bound to assess the risk of heart conditions as high, so he must choose a policy that works for his current health condition and specific requirements.
If the choice is between liquidating his investments to pay his medical bills and paying the premium for health insurance on an annual basis, the latter might turn out to be worth it.
