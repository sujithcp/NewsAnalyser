Congress president Sonia Gandhi today warned the Narendra Modi government to desist from continuing with its strategy to "murder the democracy" in India.
Gandhi was reacting to the government's all-out attack on the Congress and its prominent leaders in the AgustaWestland case.
Gandhi, along with several other party leaders including Rahul Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Mallikarjun Kharge, led a 'Save Democracy' march today from Jantar Mantar, to protest the "high-handedness" the Modi government.
They were arrested, but released later.
Addressing party members at Jantar Mantar this morning, Gandhi said her cry should be heard from Raisina Hill to Nagpur (RSS headquarters): "Do not mistake the Congress as being weak."
Describing the toppling of Congress state governments in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh as "undemocratic", Gandhi urged the party members to expose the wrongs of the Modi government.
Gandhi said Modi is only interested in "grabbing power with no concern for the real issues confronting the country".
Declaring that she and the Congress were ready for the long struggle, she said, "My life has been full of struggles and I don't back away from a fight."
Without naming the AgustaWestland scam, she accused the BJP of resorting to its old game of "character assassination" and making baseless allegations.
Incidentally, the government has made it clear that it will probe all those who have been named in the Italian judgement.
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said, "The only two people who are talked of in the country are Mohan Bhagwat and Narendra Modi.
False charges are levelled against anybody who opposes them."
The Congress leaders also created ruckus in the Parliament as well by shouting slogans against the government, which led to two Rajya Sabha adjournments.
