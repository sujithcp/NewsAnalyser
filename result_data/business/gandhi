Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has been unsparing in his criticism of Rahul Gandhi of late.
He has slammed the Congress Vice-President not only in the Lok Sabha but also on his blogs, repeatedly bringing up what he believes to be the Gandhi scion's proclivity to speak on issues without proper understanding.
On Thursday, Jaitley gave his reply to a discussion on the Finance Bill, 2016.
Members in the treasury benches were intrigued that Gandhi left the Lok Sabha just as the finance minister started speaking on his budgetary proposal to impose one per cent excise duty on jewellers.
Gandhi had opposed the decision and even joined jewellers in their protests.
Gandhi was back in the House as Jaitley moved to other clauses of the Bill.
A senior minister later wondered whether Gandhi walked out as he was apprehensive that Jaitley might ridicule him for supporting the jewellers.
