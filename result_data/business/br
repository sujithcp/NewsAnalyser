Honda, the second largest Japanese car brand in India, on Thursday launched its compact sports utility vehicle 'BR-V' in the Indian market priced at Rs 9.9 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).
The BR-V is the most affordable SUV in its category.
Though not as small as the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Mahindra TUV300 or the Ford EcoSport, the BR-V (short for Bold Runabout Vehicle) will compete against the segment best-seller Hyundai Creta, Renault Duster and Nissan Terrano.
The BR-V’s length is more than 4 metres, unlike the Brezza, TUV300 and Ecosport which fall within the prescribed limit that allows them to qualify for the tax bracket that is similar for compact cars.
While it is an all-new model from Honda the BR-V uses the same platform seen on the Brio (hatchback), Mobilio (multi-utility vehicle) and Amaze (compact sedan).
Besides the platform, the BR-V also borrows a lot of other details from its siblings.
For instance the dashboard on the BR-V is the same as the one seen on the Amaze which itself is borrowed from Jazz.
The styling is similar to the Mobilio but more modern and aggressive.
The SUV will have infotainment system that features Bluetooth for telephony and audio streaming.
Steering mounted audio controls, electrically foldable outside rear-view mirror, air-conditioning at the rear, automatic climate control are some of the features on the BR-V.
This will be a tough challenge for Honda Cars India, the local subsidiary of Honda Motor Company, Japan, as the SUV market is increasingly becoming a hotly contested segment.
The company’s recent launches have also not been able to keep up with expectations.
For instance, the three-year-old Brio generates less than 500 units in sales per month compared to Maruti Suzuki Swift which sells nearly 15,000 units every month.
Similarly the Mobilio has suffered due to a sharp decline in demand for such MUVs and MPVs.
Further, the Jazz too has seen a sharp decline even as Maruti has maintained a strong performance with the Baleno and Hyundai with the i20.
