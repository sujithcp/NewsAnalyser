The Bombay High Court's (HC) order to de-criminalise possession and consumption of beef in Maharashtra, while continuing the ban on slaughter in the state, has evoked mixed reactions.
The Court on Friday partially struck down the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, exempting possession and consumption of beef from outside.
The Opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said that the order was a big blow to the state government, which had enforced a complete beef ban and made the sale or consumption of the meat punishable by a five-year jail term and a fine of Rs 10,000.
Both Congress and the NCP alleged that BJP's real face stood exposed as the party-led government was bent on imposing a particular lifestyle on others along with pursuing the divisive politics.
Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that BJP's intention since beginning was not noble, but creating divisions among various communities.
“The High Court order partially striking down has exposed BJP's political ploy,” he said.
Meanwhile, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik welcomed the High Court order and said that people habituated to eat bull and bullock beef will continue to do so from now.
“The fundamental right has been restored,” he opined.
Bhimrao Dhonde, a BJP legislator from the drought-hit Beed district in parched Marathwada, said that the government's priority should be to support farmers, and they should be allowed to sell their cattle to whoever they wish to.
“It is time to withdraw the ban,” Dhonde stated, adding that the government's ban on sale of unproductive cattle has adversely impacted farmers as they had to bear additional burden.
Dhonde informed that more than 3,50,000 cattle in Marathwada are housed in camps located in the worst-affected districts of Beed, Latur and Osmanabad.
While referring to the state finance minister Sudhir Mungatiwar's announcement in the Annual Budget on the establishment of “Govardhan Govansh Raksha Kendra” in 34 rural districts for rearing of non-lactating and unproductive cattle breed with participation of NGOs, he said that not a single such centre has been formed so far and that there was no transfer of non-lactating and unproductive cattle there.
The one-time grant of Rs 1 crore as announced, too, is yet to reach the districts.
Interestingly, BJP’s ally — Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) — reiterated its opposition to the state law stating that it has not resulted in the increase in number of cattle population though there has been rise in milk production.
Sadabhau Khot, state SSS chief, observed that the High Court's order allowing eating and keeping of beef from outside Maharashtra will not help the local farmers as the ban on sale of unproductive cattle continues.
He claimed that cattle are dying of thirst and hunger.
Khot demanded that the government should step up its efforts to save cattle while providing due attention on farmers.
Imtiyaz Jaleel, a legislator from All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen said, “We are surprised.
It seems the court want to say yes and no at the same time.
The Court has pleased the government and at the same time has given a free hand for public to consume beef which comes from outside the state.
However, the real question is how and from where people will get beef for storage and eating.
In the Parliament, it was informed by the government that during 2015-16, about 21 communal riots took place due to transportation of cattle.
Actually, this is the real issue which would have been addressed by the court.”
He added that the present condition of farmers and also of cattle in drought hit districts in the state is really pathetic and the government's announcement to open cattle camps has been an eye wash.“We will approach the Supreme Court with a plea to allow the slaughtering of bull and bullock above 16 years of age and sale of their beef in Maharashtra.
Today’s High Court order does not permit sale of beef within the state as the Court has allowed transportation of beef from outside the state for its consumption and possession,” said Arif Chowdhury, president, Jamat-ul-Quresh Minority Association, one of the petitioners in the case.
While the Opposition slammed the BJP as its ploy to impose a certain lifestyle was exposed, allies bat for efforts to save cattle dying from thirst & hunger
