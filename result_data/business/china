By Manish Sabharwal At a panel on jobs at the Asian Development Bank annual meetings in Frankfurt last week, a German minister said, "We are not against free trade but want fair trade."
This clever rhetoric plays to the growing demand by low-skilled voters in rich countries, for protection against imports from developing countries.
I had three counters.
First, the definition of individual needs, wants and desires changes with rising income.
Asking poor countries to apply the same environmental standards, social protection and wages is equivalent to rich countries lifting up the ladder behind them, after having become rich.
Second, India has the most green jobs in the world because poverty and agriculture are very green.
Third, countries may have a right to choose which goods enter their borders but please don't patronise developing countries by telling us that restricting trade is for our own good.
Predictably, those arguments were mocked by a rich country trade union leader on the panel who said the lack of global standards on wages, etc., was a violation of human rights.
Overall the conference reinforced a lingering suspicion that while China's farm to non-farm transition happened through factories, India's will happen through sales, customer service, logistics, education, healthcare and other domestic consumption - for the following five reasons.
First, global trade outlook.
China entered global trade in 1978, at the start of a 30 year window of developed country congruence of politics and economics that let China's trade reach 55% of GDP.
But developed countries are entering a phase where good economics will be bad politics.
Trump's rhetoric on walls, tariffs and China did not create the discontent with offshore production; it is only an expression of it.
Second, global growth outlook.
China entered global trade at the start of a 30 year super cycle of global growth.
But developed country growth has not recovered from the global financial crisis.
Demographics - the sale of adult diapers crossed that of baby diapers in Japan - means they may be in secular stagnation.
Third, manufacturing reboot.
China entered manufacturing when labour costs were a binding constraint.
But technology has now reduced its employment intensity.
China's lock on global manufacturing supply chains despite higher wages is stronger than most people think.
And they bought 69% of global industrial robots produced last year.
Fourth, infrastructure creation.
China used more cement in the 5 years starting 2008 than the US used through all of the 20th century.
Exactly 10 years ago the Chinese economy was the same size as the Indian economy today, but they were growing at 13% relative to our 7% now.
Call it the fixed costs of democracy, but India will not build the physical infrastructure for global manufacturing as quickly or substantially as China.
Fifth, economic complexity.
Ricardo Hausman of Harvard suggests that the best predictor of sustained economic success is economic complexity.
The Indian economy is much more economically complex than China was at comparable income; we make everything and do everything.
Of course we don't always do it well or at scale.
But in our complexity lies the seeds of robust domestic consumption that could reduce our poverty.
These five reasons also suggest that India's economic trajectory will have more in common with the US than China.
Both India and the US have 11% of their labour force working in manufacturing and only 25% of GDP is trade (imports plus exports).
More importantly, we are loud democracies where anybody can say no and nobody can say yes to difficult policy change.
The obvious difference is that 3% of US workers toil on farms while 50% do so in India.
Just as most US workers have jobs making or doing things for each other, India's 24 crore underemployed farmers and 1.2 crore young people joining the labour force every year could find jobs in domestic non-farm consumption.
Massive job creation needs a single domestic market (my guesstimate is that the GST delay costs India 1 lakh formal jobs every month), lower regulatory cholesterol (90% of India works in low productivity informal enterprises that are dwarfs rather than babies), macroeconomic stability (fiscal discipline with low interest rates ), decentralisation (more funds, functions and functionaries for state governments), infrastructure (we only have 50 cities with more than a million people versus China's 385; shoving more people into these creaking cities is murdering productivity), and higher workforce skills (the most important vocational skills for the new world of work may be reading, writing, and arithmetic).
This agenda recognises that the role of the government in job creation is not setting things on fire but creating conditions for spontaneous combustion.
The Frankfurt meeting and US election rhetoric (Trump and Clinton) suggest that free trade and offshore production is complicating developed country politics - voters like globalisation as consumers but not as workers.
Of course cooler heads may prevail and free trade bashing may get an election drubbing.
Even though India cannot take China's model of exporting its way out of poverty for granted, our rising attractiveness as a foreign investment destination is wonderful because workers are indifferent about Make in India or Make for India.
But India's job emergency needs politicians and policy makers blocking or deferring reforms to think harder about a Plan B anchored in domestic consumption.
