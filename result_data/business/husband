Police personnel searching Bihar Legislative Council member Manorama Devi's Gaya home for her son Rocky Yadav - who has since been arrested in a road rage case - accidentally discovered six bottles of liquor.
But charges of violation of prohibition were not pressed against her.
The police explained that in Bihar "women generally don't drink".
The FIR, however, mentioned the name of her husband Bindeshwari Prasad Yadav, who is in judicial custody for allegedly helping his son escape after the crime.
State Excise Minister Abdul Jalil Mastan said: " Us aurat ka malik kaun hai?
Husband hai.
Humne husband par FIR kiya hai (who is her master?
Her husband.
So we have lodged an FIR against him)."
