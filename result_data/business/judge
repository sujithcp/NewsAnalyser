Former Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi arriving at the CBI HQ, New Delhi in connection with alleged corruption in the 3,600 crore AgustaWestland choppers deal.
Denting the Congress’ defence in the ongoing AgustaWestland controversy, the Italian judge in the case has said that the note, which mentions ‘AP’ as a recipient of a bribe as authentic, NDTV reported .
The Centre has alleged that this ‘AP’ stands for Ahmed Patel, Chief Advisor to Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Congress in the Parliament had challenged the authenticity of this document.
The note that Judge Marco Maria Maiga is talking about refers to the one written by Guido Haschke, one of the three middlemen said to have bribed Indians for the deal.
The Centre wants to question Haschke on the scam.
“My judgment does not give a clean chit to Indian politicians.
It is up to India to now follow up on investigating its politicians,” the judge told NDTV.
He added that his trial focused on Italians who bribed Indians for a helicopter deal.
Elaborating on Haschke’s version, the judge said that he was vague in stating who ‘AP’ was in the list that he had.
The list also contained notes like ‘FAM’ and ‘POL’; the former is believed to be the family of former IAF chief SP Tyagi.
The judge added that there was substantial evidence against Tyagi for accepting kickbacks.
The notes were reviewed in the Italian court, which referred to top Congress leaders, including Sonia Gandhi.
Gandhi was said to be ‘the driving force’ of India’s decision to buy these helicopters when Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power.
The revelations have rocked the ongoing Parliament session ever since it has begun.
