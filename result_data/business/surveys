DMDK founder Vijayakant has flayed poll surveys by two Tamil TV channels, alleging that it was an "imposing" of viewpoints as both surveys gave different trends.
Addressing a poll rally here last night, the DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance Chief Ministerial candidate said while one of them favoured a good show by the ruling AIADMK, the other gave DMK a chance.
"These are not poll surveys but an imposing of a viewpoint.
The people of Tamil Nadu will not get swayed by these," he said in his brief address.
Vijayakant was campaigning for alliance party candidate G Bhimrao of CPI (M) who is contesting from Maduravoyal here.
The actor-turned-politician said such surveys apart, his party coalition will win the May 16 polls, much like DMK founder CN Annadurai led his party to victory in 1967, ushering in the first non-Congress government in Tamil Nadu.
DMDK is facing the polls in alliance with the four-party People's Welfare Front comprising MDMK, CPI(M), CPI, and VCK, and TMC.
