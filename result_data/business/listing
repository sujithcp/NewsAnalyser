National Stock Exchange
Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has told the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) that the present regulations do not provide for 'self-listing' of a stock exchange.
NSE has been lobbying hard for self-listing for some time now, arguing that it is an accepted practice in developed markets.
We take a look at some common terms associated with listing of exchanges and why NSE has been reluctant to cross-list its shares:
What is self-listing?
When a stock exchange self-lists it means it has listed on its own exchange.
For example, if NSE self-lists its shares would be available for trading on NSE and not on any other stock exchange such as BSE or Metropolitan Stock Exchange.
According to experts, self-listing is an accepted practice in certain developed markets wherein the conflicts of interest are under check because of segregation of regulatory functions of the self-listed stock exchange.
Self-listed stock exchanges include the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Singapore Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, Euronext and Nasdaq.
Most of these exchanges have found a way around to deal with the inherent conflict of interest that comes with self-listing.
For instance, to ensure the integrity of trading in its securities, the ASX entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Australian regulator, Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), whereby the latter monitors and supervises ASX's compliance as a listed entity and exercises all powers regarding the admission or removal of ASX from the official list, and the granting, stopping or suspending of the quotation of ASX's securities, in a manner similar to what ASX would do in respect of other listed entities.
What is the problem with self-listing in case of an Indian exchange?
Exchanges have twin roles: commercial and regulatory.
The commercial function includes providing a platform for listing, trading and provision of other services.
Regulatory role involves regulating the listed entities and brokers and other intermediaries.
According to experts, Indian exchanges are not ready for self-listing because of non-segregation of regulatory functions from day to day operations and due to other conflicts arising out of the rigorous oversight which the Indian exchanges exercise over the listed companies.
Besides, current norms do not allow for self-listing.
While Sebi had issued a notification earlier this year amending the Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations regulations, making it easier for exchanges to list, it did not allow them to opt for self-listing.
"A recognised stock exchange may apply for listing of its securities on any recognised stock exchange, other than itself and its associated stock exchange," say the amended regulations.
What is cross-listing?
Cross-listing is the listing of a company's shares on a different exchange than its primary and original stock exchange.
In the case of an exchange, this could mean BSE would list on the NSE and vice-versa.
In order to be approved for cross-listing, the exchange must meet the same requirements as any other listed member of the exchange such as filing requirements for financial reports and company revenues.
Why is NSE opposed to cross-listing?
NSE feels its own exchange would offer better liquidity for trading its shares compared to rival BSE.
Cross-listing would also involve sharing all compliance-related information to BSE.
NSE believes that it would be more comfortable if regulated or supervised by a competent regulatory authority rather than by another exchange.
Are there any circumstances under which NSE would be willing to cross-list?
NSE has said that it will consider the option of listing on rival BSE if all mandatory disclosures are directly sent to either the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) or another regulatory body.
Can NSE opt for overseas listing?
In 2013, the government had allowed unlisted companies to directly list on stock exchanges abroad without prior or simultaneous listing on Indian bourses.
However, current norms for listing of exchanges do not talk about overseas listing.
According to experts, the current norms governing listing of exchanges may require appropriate amendments to allow for an overseas listing.
Furthermore, the market regulator may not be in favour of overseas listing considering that exchanges are first line regulators and public money is involved.
Knowing these terms is essential now that NSE may be willing to cross-list if disclosures are sent to Sebi
