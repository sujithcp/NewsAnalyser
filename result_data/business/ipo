Maharashtra-based dairy products company Parag Milk Foods managed to successfully closed its Rs 750-crore initial public offering (IPO) on Wednesday.
The company received 1.15 times subscription in the qualified institutional buyer (QIB) segment.
Parag Milk's IPO was forced to cut the issue price and extend closing by three days as it had not garnered the full QIB participation.
The dairy products firm has lowered its price band to Rs 215-227 a share from the earlier band of Rs 220-227 a share.
On an overall basis, the IPO was subscribed 1.83 times.
Retail portion was subscribed two times and high networth individual (HNI) segment was subscribed 3.1 times.
"During the extended period up to May 11, 2016, the public issue witnessed additional participation from QIBs and investors in other categories who could not invest earlier due to regional holidays in Asia," said Devendra Shah, chairman, Parag Milk.
As Parag Milk didn't meet Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)'s profitability criteria, its IPO was a qualified institutional buyer (QIB)-backed issue.
According to Sebi norms, if a company that doesn't have a profitability track record comes out with an IPO, it should get at least 75% of QIB participation as opposed to 50% in normal IPOs.
Also, retail participation in such IPOs is restricted to only 10% against 35%.
