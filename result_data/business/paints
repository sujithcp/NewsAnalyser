Asian Paints reported in-line numbers for the March 2016 quarter (Q4).
Healthy volume growth, estimated at 12-13 per cent, in the domestic decorative paints segment along-with continued improvement in industrial paints demand aided top-line.
Even if the low base effect of the March 2015 quarter -- when volumes grew just 4 per cent -- is adjusted for, the uptick is healthy.
Analysts believe revenues were driven by higher growth in the economy paints segment over premium paints.
Asian Paints' consolidated revenues grew 12.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3,919 crore versus Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 3,860 crore.
Though volumes are largely driven by price cuts and the low-base effect helped, the uptick is noteworthy given the challenging demand environment.
Going forward, a good monsoon, implementation of 7th Pay Commission hike as well as one rank one pay (OROP) could act as catalysts to demand.
Management though remains cautiously optimistic.
In Q4, benign input cost inflation led to a 191 basis points expansion in EBITDA ( earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin to 18 per cent, even as some of the cost savings were passed on to customers via price cuts.
Higher tax rate (up 225 basis points to 34.8 per cent), however restricted net profit growth to 19.9 per cent.
Consequently, at Rs 409 crore, profit was lower than Bloomberg estimate of Rs 436 crore.
Margins could continue to benefit from input cost tailwinds in the next couple of quarters, though further price cuts could offset some of the gains, say analysts.
Also, rising oil prices and investments in newer businesses could contain margins.
Given the continued demand slowdown, Asian Paints' strategy of boosting volumes and maintaining margins makes sense, especially in the wake of increasing competition from unorganised players.
Asian Paints' home improvement business (Sleek kitchen solutions, Ess Ess sanitaryware) also grew by a good 21.4 per cent in Q4 to Rs 72 crore.
But for the slowing consumption demand, these businesses would have grown at a faster pace.
These businesses continue to be in investment phase and hence, posted loss of Rs 15 crore in Q4.
Asian Paints plans to leverage its strong distribution network to cross-sell these products.
Its international business (19 per cent of revenues) grew at a steady clip of 16.2 per cent driven by continued traction in Middle East, Ethiopia and Bangladesh.
Asian Paints scrip currently trades at rich valuations of 40 times FY17 estimated earnings.
Nevertheless, most analysts remain positive on the company given that it stands to gain from growing demand of paints in the country and expect its earnings to grow at a healthy pace.
They are also enthused by the company's foray into adhesives segment and will keenly watch out for management strategy on growing this business.
