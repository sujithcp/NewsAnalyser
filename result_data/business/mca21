"We will continue to monitor the situation and work closely with the Ministry.
We expect the situation to come back to normal in the next few weeks," an Infosys spokesperson said in a statement while responding to queries related to MCA21 problems.
Infosys said that subsequent to new Companies Act, it has upgraded the MCA21 system to run on the SAP platform.
"Post the go-live, as on April 22, over 1,183 Indian companies have been incorporated and 1,647 Limited Liability Partnerships have been registered on the system.
"In addition, since March 27, 2016, there have been more than two lakh filings.
Looking at the data for the week gone by in 2015 during the same week, we have had an average of 8013 filings per day (excluding the weekends) while the current average is around 9,759, an increase of more than 20 per cent," the company said.
Further, Infosys said that during the first couple of weeks, after migrating to the new system, there were some issues which by and large have been sorted out.
"There were some delays in the incorporation of some companies due to holidays.
The Ministry has made arrangements to clear the pendency by deploying additional Assessment Officers," it noted.
Meanwhile, following the MCA21 glitches, the Ministry has extended the deadline for submitting various filings without additional fee till May 10.
