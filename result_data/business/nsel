A Delhi-based businessman Vishvanidhi Dalmia has filed a recovery suit on Friday in the Bombay High Court against brokerage India Infoline Ltd and its four officials including chairman Nirmal Jain following delay in recovery of money invested in scam hit National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) .
With a business interest in real estate, exports of garments and investment in securities markets instruments, Dalmia has filed the suit for recovery of Rs 11.38 crore including an actual investment sum of Rs 7.60 crore and interest at 18 per cent to the tune of Rs 3.78 crore.
Earlier, one city-based investor had filed a case against another large broker for recovery of Rs 9 crore in NSEL scam.
Finance ministry had already asked Sebi also to investigate brokers in NSEL scam.
Markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has formed a committee to look into the role of brokers in NSEL case.
" IIFL introduced NSEL to me with luring interest in commodities' trade between 13-15 per cent per annum.
IIFL told me that the government owned National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) is a shareholder in the company.
NSEL is well regulated and its contracts are backed by full stocks.
Hence, IIFL should pay the amount due with NSEL," said Dalmia who alleged IIFL for mis-selling, false representation, inducement and modifying the client-broker agreement.
Earlier officials of many brokerages were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police on charges of inducement and mis-selling of NSEL products.
Enforcement Directorate is also investigating the case for possibility of money laundering.
IFL spokesperson said that: "We have not received any such notice.
The allegations are with an ulterior motive and malafied intention.
We reiterate and strongly deny such allegations.
As the public is aware, the matter related to NSEL defaulting to investors is under investigation/consideration for the last two-and-a-half years by the government/investigating agencies/regulators and court.
