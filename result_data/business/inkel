KOCHI: INKEL Limited, Kerala's PPP-model infrastructure development company promoted by the state government, posted 25% increase in net profit in 2015-16 with a net profit of Rs 19.67 crores, up 25 per cent from a year earlier.
"The pattern of revenue earnings during 2015-16 changed substantially due to the success of commissioning of tower 2 at the INKEL business park in Angamaly, Thrissur, and diversifying into core areas like bridges and roads.
Deployment of large funds for development activities is a key reason for the change in revenue pattern," said T Balakrishan , managing director, INKEL.
Consolidated revenue for the year was pegged at Rs 39.99 crores with a net profit before tax of Rs 19.67 crore.
INKEL has also forayed into solar engineering, facility management, advisory and consultancy, and modern agri farming.
The Piravom farm is fully commissioned and the agri farm project in Palakkad is under implementation.
Additionally, 21 industrial enterprises and seven educational institutions have come up at Inkel Greens in Malappuram.
"The total value of the projects in hand, both ongoing and those in the pipeline, stands at Rs 600 crores in the current financial year.
The revenue is expected to grow substantially in the next fiscal with the growth in construction, bridges and roads, and contribution from new verticals," said Balakrishnan.
