NEW DELHI: To mitigate the ostensible damage done to the BJP's poll prospects in Kerala in the wake of PM Modi's comparison of the state with Somalia, a clutch of BJP leaders, Union ministers and MPs have been pressed into the campaign there.
The 'carpet-bombing' being done by BJP to salvage the situation just three days before the campaigning ends is likely to see Union ministers Rajnath Singh , Nitin Gadkari , M Venkaiah Naidu , Suresh Prabhu, JP Nadda, Smriti Irani, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal campaigning for the party.
MPs like Nalin Kateel and Arjun Meghwal would also be in action, sources said.
Some ministers and MPs who were not keen to go have been asked to cancel all personal and professional engagements to campaign extensively for the party over the next two days, party sources said.
