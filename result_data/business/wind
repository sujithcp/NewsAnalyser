The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has made a number of recommendations to effectively deal with the situation arising out of failure of transmission system.
The authority has made a strong case for further stepping up patrolling of lines especially in February and March before onset of storm and heavy winds.
Further, ir recommended that frequency of patrolling should be increased in theft prone areas to avoid failures due to thefts of towers.
The Bureau of Indian Standards be requested for an early completion of revision of the wind map of the country.
CEA appointed expert committee, which investigated about 29 incidents of failure of transmission towers across the country during October 2014 and June 2015, has cited several cases wherein theft or sabotage of part of transmission tower makes the tower structurally weak which ultimately leads to failure during high speed wind, storm, whirlwind and cyclone.
The committee argued that education of local people is required so that they can participate with the transmission companies in patrolling and curb thefts.
The committee observed that most of the failures are linked to high wind speed.
According to the committee, in the absence of meteorological data, it is become difficult to assess the actual wind velocity at site of failure in order to verify with design value of wind speed.
The committee observed that in some cases the high wind velocity during storm, cyclone and local phenomenon of whirlwind and gale might have exceeded the wind speed for which the tower is designed.
According to the committee, this type of wind is difficult to predict and the probability of such occurences is low and the tower design will be uneconomical if such situation is considered in the design.
However, the committee suggested that the wind data available from 800 wind data measurement stations established by National Institute of Wind Energy could be used for wind zone mapping and estimating wind speed in areas where towers have collapsed.
CEA along with public and private transmission companies are expected to soon hold meeting with National Institute of Wind Energy for effective use of wind data.
In order to avoid soil erosion, the committee called for comprehensive soil investigation as it will help provide proper protection to the transmission towers.
Further, an executive with the transmission company, who did not want to be identified, told Business Standard , ''In some cases, review of the design of tower and foundation is also required in view of nature of failure.''
He referred to the committee recommendation that tower design can be checked according to latest IS:802 taking into consideration narrow front wind on tower body and 75 per cent of wind load in broker wire condition for suspension towers.
