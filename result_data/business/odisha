BJD members today walked out of Lok Sabha protesting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley underscoring the Centre's commitment to the Polavaram project, which is being opposed by Odisha.
As Jaitley wound up his reply to the discussion on the Finance Bill, he sought to assuage the concerns of TDP members over revenue deficit of Andhra Pradesh by reeling out figures to underlince the increase in allotment of funds to the state.
BJD-ruled Odisha has also been demanding a special status for it.
Jaitley referred to Polavaram, a major irrigation project which has drawn Odisha's objection over its fears that part of its territory would be submerged, and insisted that the Centre would stick to the commitment made to Andhra Pradesh.
BJD's Bhartruhari Mahtab rose in protest and was heard saying that the matter is in the Supreme Court, an apparent reference to Odisha moving the court against the project.
"We can look at Odisha's grievances independently.
I can't go back on the Andhra Act," Jaitley said.
Expressing their dissatisfaction over his response, BJD members staged a walkout.
