"Uttarakhand floor test outcome is a huge setback to (the) Modi government," Kejriwal tweeted
NEW DELHI: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Congress' win in the Uttarakhand floor test was a "huge setback" to the Narendra Modi-led central government.
"Uttarakhand floor test outcome is a huge setback to (the) Modi government," Kejriwal tweeted, minutes after the voting in the hill state assembly was over.
"Hope they (the central government) will stop toppling governments now," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader added.
In Uttarakhand, the Congress claimed to have won the floor test.
However, the result will be declared officially by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
