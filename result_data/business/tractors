While new tractor sales have been on the slow lane in the past few years, owing to weak monsoon that dampened rural buying, old tractors sales, however, is seeing some traction.
The country's largest organised channel for used tractor transactions, Shriram Automall India (SAMIL) said that on the whole the used tractor space has clocked growth in the past two years or so.
SAMIL has seen 10-15% year-on-year growth in used tractors, and the unorganised industry is expected to have grown at 5-8%.
This is at a time when the overall new tractors space in the country has shrunk from 6,30,000 tractors in FY11 to 4,95,000 units in FY16.
Sameer Malhotra, CEO of Shriram Automall, said that the size of the used tractors space is almost 10-15% more in terms of volumes than the new tractor industry.
However, bulk of the trading happens through unorganised channels.
Ravindra Shahane, vice-president — marketing, farm division, Mahindra and Mahindra, explained that dealers of new tractors often buy used tractors from farmers as an exchange option, and then they re-sell these through their network.
Tractor OEMs are hardly involved in the used tractor business.
Malhotra further explained that right before the sowing season, transactions pick up and there is usually a build up of used tractors too in the system.
However, going forward, if the monsoons are not as expected, then the buying of new tractors taper down.
Many farmers, however, then prefer to buy old ones from the unorganised channels or through the dealer networks.
Shriram Automall organises bidding to facilitate trade of used vehicles and equipment, starting from pre-owned commercial vehicles, construction equipment, tractors, buses, cars, three wheelers, as well as two-wheelers.
It is the largest organised channel for used tractor sales in the country, and as Malhotra informed, it sells around 1500-1600 tractors per month, and around 18,000-20,000 tractors in a year.
"Our sales of used tractors have been witnessing a 10-15% year-on-year growth, and the unorganised space too has been clocking a 5-8% growth rate," Malhotra said.
Used tractor dealers in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu said that while business has not been very brisk, business has seen some demand growth nonetheless.
This year, with forecast of an above normal monsoon, the tractor industry feels there will be at least a 10% upside in demand for new tractors.
This should augur well for the used tractors space as well.
Already players like Mahindra and Mahindra (which command a 40-41% market share), have seen sales picking up in April.
The company sold 21,386 units in April, up 18%.
Other players like Escorts and Sonalika too saw sales growing in the range of 7-10%.
