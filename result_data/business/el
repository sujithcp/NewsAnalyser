The El Nino phenomenon, marked by warmer than normal temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, is finally at its terminal stage.
NEW DELHI: Prospects of a good monsoon have improved as the crucial weather system is likely to hit the Kerala coast on the normal date of June 1, while the risk of a lingering El Nino, which disrupts rainfall in the region, has been eliminated by favourable changes in ocean temperatures, international and Indian forecasters said.
That's good news for farmers and policy makers, as vast areas of the country suffered a drought for two years, which has hit farm output and dried up crucial reservoirs, because El Nino continued to haunt South Asian weather since last year.
The El Nino phenomenon, marked by warmer than normal temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, is finally at its terminal stage, while trade winds, a key contributor to weather patterns, are blowing normally again.
"Sea surface temperatures across the tropical Pacific Ocean cooled further in the past fortnight, driven by cooler than average waters below the surface," the Australian Weather Bureau, a globally respected forecaster, said in its latest assessment of El Nino.
"Atmospheric indicators are also trending towards normal.
Trade winds have been consistently near normal for some weeks.
Typical El Nino cloud patterns are dissipating."
El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, is poised to give way to La Nina, or little girl, which usually intensifies monsoon rainfall.
The Australian weather office said it has issued a "La Nina Watch" as the opposite phenomenon, which boosts rainfall in India , is likely to set in the next few months, according to seven of the eight major international climate models it surveyed.
US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is also watching out for La Nina and says that many parts of the Pacific, particularly in the eastern part of ocean, have already cooled, signalling the end of El Nino.
