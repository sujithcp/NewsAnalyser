In a statement lashed with sarcasm, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav today said the "Jungle Raj II government" in the state is performing "better" than the Central government.
"If we compare with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, development is taking place at a very fast pace in Jungle Raj II in Bihar," Tejashwi told reporters sarcastically.
Referring to Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari's claim that National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was constructing 75 km of roads per day in the country, Tejashwi claimed the body built "merely 60 km roads in Bihar in 2015-16, whereas Bihar's Public Works Department constructed 1,500 km of roads in the same period".
Talking about his tenure as the state road construction minister, he said NHAI laid foundation stones for 20 km in Bihar, while state agencies for 750 km.
"Our Grand Alliance government has started implementing promises made before the Assembly polls.
We've implemented total prohibition, besides taking steps to give loans of up to Rs 4 lakh through student credit card, 35 per cent quota for women, free wi-fi in university and colleges," Tejashwi said.
"Our government has started delivering results in just six months.
This is just a beginning and we will work hard to fulfil our promises," the Deputy Chief Minister said.
He was speaking to reporters with newly-nominated RJD youth wing national president Bulo Mandal, a Lok Sabha member from Bhagalpur, and Mohammad Kari Suhaib, who was appointed RJD Bihar's youth wing president.
As part of RJD's expansion plans ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Tejashwi stressed the need for strengthening party's organisational structure across the country in which, the youth wing would play a important role.
Prominent among those present on the occasion were state unit president Ram Chandra Purbe, national spokesman Manoj Jha and ministers in the Nitish government Alok Mehta and Shiv Chandra Ram.
