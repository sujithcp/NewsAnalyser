The payment was made in respect of procurement of raw material for NINL's steel plant located at Duburi in Odisha's Jajpur district and also for sale of finished goods.
MMTC is the biggest shareholder in NINL with an equity of 49.9 per cent.

Central PSUs like National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bhel Ltd and Mecon have minor equity participation.
There is a mutual arrangement between MMTC and other promoters of NINL for payment of commission to the former.
Mecon has been engaged as the consultant to examine the feasibility of expansion of NINL's steel making capacity to five million tonne per annum (mtpa), up from 1.1 mtpa presently.

As per the rough estimates of Mecon, the fund for NINL's first phase expansion has been worked out at Rs 5600 crore.
Out of this, the promoters' contribution comes to nearly Rs 1000 crore.
MMTC's share would be in the range of Rs 400-500 crore and the rest equity would come from other promoters.

The captive mine has 110 million tonne of iron ore deposits and promises to save Rs 250 crore every year for NINL.
