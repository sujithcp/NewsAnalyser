NEW DELHI: The BJP estimates that the Opposition Congress will remain the largest party in the Rajya Sabha even after the elections to 57 seats across 15 states for which the Election Commission announced June 11 polls on Thursday.
"We will gain and Congress will lose some of its strength, but we will not become the largest party," a senior BJP functionary said.
Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by MLAs of each state through preferential voting and relative strength in the assembly decides how many MPs a party can elect.
According to rough calculations based on BJP's strength across 15 states, the party is set to gain only marginally after the retirement of 14 of its MPs.
The BJP functionary calculates his party would win 17 MPs for 57 vacancies to which polls will be held in June.
The death of Praveen Rashtrapal, a sitting Congress Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat, on Thursday, may benefit the BJP whenever elections are announced for the vacancy.
Even that would mean 18 new BJP MPs, a net gain of four, joining the Upper House after 14 retirements.
BJP's tally, which stands at 49 will move up to 53 but a Congress hopeful of re-nomination to Rajya Sabha estimates that the party's tally may remain at 60 even after the erosion in its strength during the biennial polls.
With the terms of ministers Venkaiah Naidu , Birender Singh, Suresh Prabhu, Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi coming to an end, there will be only 11 seats for several party hopefuls to secure a RS nomination of the BJP, if all the ministers are given renomination.
