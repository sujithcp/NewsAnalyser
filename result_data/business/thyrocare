By Sanam Mirchandani MUMBAI: Diagnostics firm Thyrocare Technologies made a stellar debut on the bourses on Monday, listing 48.4% above its issue price of Rs 446 on the BSE, indicating high investor interest in the diagnostics segment.
Buoyant market sentiment too aided the stock.
Thyrocare's opening price in percentage terms was the best for a company on listing day since Sharda Cropchem, which listed 63% above its issue price in September 2014.
After opening at Rs 662, Thyrocare's scrip touched a high of Rs 665.40 intraday, before ending at Rs 618.10, up 38.6% from its issue price.
The high listing of the Thyrocare Technologies stock follows enthusiastic response to its initial public offer last month, which got subscribed 73.55 times.
Analysts are positive on the company due to its low capex business model and presence in the niche high-growth segment but added that sustainability of the high valuations remains a question.
"If one wants to play the pathology labs story, then it is a good bet.
Between Thyrocare and Dr Lal PathLabs, the former has a better margin profile and there is enough room for growth.
The kind of tests Dr Lal does runs into thousand in numbers, while Thyrocare does about 190," said Meeta Shetty, analyst at Kotak Securities.
"At Rs 3,500 crore market cap, it would imply 48 times FY17 estimated earnings, which for a 20% RoEcompany is expensive.
The next two years' earnings have been factored in at these valuations," said Ravi Shenoy, VP-Midcaps Research at Motilal Oswal Securities.
Both the analysts do not have an active coverage on the stock.
(BCCL and / or its subsidiaries holds 0.56% of the Equity capital of Thyrocare Technologies Ltd as on * the date of filing of the DRHP)
