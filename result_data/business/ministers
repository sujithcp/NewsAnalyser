LONDON: European stock markets rose at the start of trading Tuesday, as eurozone finance ministers looked set to sign off more bailout cash for Greece before the end of the month.
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent to 6,151.27 points compared with Monday's close.
In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX 30 index advanced 0.8 percent to 10,057.53 points and the Paris CAC 40 won 0.4 percent to 4,338.05.
Eurozone finance ministers on Monday gave themselves until May 24 to reach a deal on debt relief and unlocking bailout cash for Greece as they lauded Athens for passing tough reforms.
The 19 ministers meeting in Brussels failed to sign off on the long-delayed first review of last July's 86-billion-euro ($95 billion) EU-IMF bailout -- but said this could be done in the "coming days".
