Rice may become costlier by at least 10-15% in coming months due to lower production estimates following incidence of El Nino caused deficient monsoon rainfalls in the previous two seasons.
Lower and uneven distribution of rainfalls in the last two monsoon seasons prevented farmers to bring in normal area under rice (paddy) sowing.
Consequently, the Ministry of Agriculture in its Second Advanced Estimates forecast rice output in India to decline by around 2 million tonnes at 103.61 million tonnes.
Trade sources, however, forecast India's rice output to decline between three and five million tonnes this crop year ending June 2016.
Rice, the staple food among average middle class in many Indian states including the North, South etc., however, is unlikely to see a sharp increase in its prices because of two major factors.
First, its availability has been abundant in government's warehouses owned by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and private households.
Second, India's Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has reiterated several times in the past that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government would not allow commodity prices to move up.
Unfortunately, however, the government cannot prevent rice price to move in tune with market forces.
"India's rice output is estimated to decline by around three million tonnes in the current crop year which poses a threat for price rise.
The incidence of El Nino is causing a real concern with drought in major parts of south and north Indian states and also hot weather.
But, the price of rice would not see a sharp increase due to surplus monsoon rainfalls forecast in the ensuing season and abundance of stocks piled up within the country," said T Ram, Scientist, Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR), a Hyderabad-based premier rice research firm.
Driven by Asia, global rice output is estimated to decline by 0.7% to 491.4 million tonnes in 2015 as compared to 494.7 million tonnes in the previous year.
Feared by lower output, many export reliant countries including Egypt, Thailand and Vietnam have started quoting higher for next shipment.
While Egypt has increased its quote by 1.5%, Thailand also revised its export quotation with the benchmark Thai 100%B white rice averaging $389 per tonne, almost 4 percent higher than in January, on a stronger Baht and expectations of new trade agreements.
Prices also increased in Pakistan, due to ongoing sales to Africa.
Substantiating the production estimate of India's Ministry of Agriculture, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations forecast reduction in rice output in several countries including India, which endured a number of adverse climatic events during the cropping season.
Hot weather and lower rainfalls caused due to incidence of the El Nino in the monsoon season 2014-15 were somewhat lower but higher in 2015-16 which grappled many rice producing countries in Asian region.
Since, Asia contributes over 60% of rice output in the world, lower production in this region could trigger price rise.
FAO's latest forecast points to a global harvest of 491.4 million tonnes (milled basis) of rice in 2015.
This level would represent a 3.4 million-tonne contraction from the already disappointing outturn of 2014, reflecting the negative impact of adverse weather conditions associated with the prevailing El Nino episode.
"Price spurt, however, would be capped due to huge availability of stocks with the government and Indian households," said V K Chaturvedi, Managing Director, Usher Agro Ltd, a non-basmati rice producer listed on stock exchanges.
Meanwhile, total rice stocks with the government's Food Corporation of India stood at 22.16 million tonnes as of April 1, 2016 compared with 19.42 million tonnes in the previous month and a mere 12.69 million tonnes as of January 1, 2016.
Rice stock, however, shows a jump of 5 million tonnes from 17.09 million tonnes on April 1, 2015.
Rajan Sundareshan, Executive Director, All India Rice Exporters' Association, believes India has enough rice stocks.
Interestingly, falling export demand has increased India's domestic availability of rice which arrested price increase.
Data compiled by Apeda showed India's exports at 5.72 million tonnes between April '15 and February '16 as compared to 7.62 million tonnes in the same period last year.
