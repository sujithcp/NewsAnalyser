 Over the past three months, the medium-to-long term gilt funds have delivered 4.38% return — the best in the entire debt fund category.
MUMBAI: Despite a healthy performance of late, gilt funds are seeing fall in investor interest.
Over the past three months, the medium-to-long term gilt funds have delivered 4.38% return — the best in the entire debt fund category.
Between February and April, however, the category has seen continuous net outflows totalling more than Rs 2,000 crore.
In sharp contrast to this, gilt funds were getting heavy inflows in the early months of last year, as investors were betting heavily on yields to soften as the government took up aggressive rate cuts.
But contrary to expectations, yield on the 10-year government bond remained firm, putting downward pressure on bond prices.
Despite more than 75 basis point rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India , gilt funds had languished until the first nine months of the last fiscal, causing investors to start pulling out.
Arun Gopalan, VP-Research, Systematix Shares & Stocks , explains the pull-out from gilt funds: "A dicey yields scenario prompted investors to shift money out of the gilt funds."
And this trend continues even after the recent spurt in performance.
Experts feel that there is no need for investors to take aggressive position in gilt funds now.
"Even though we expect rates to come off, these are not likely to come in quick succession.
The impact of the cuts on the yields is likely to be muted," said Gopalan.
Investors should also be worried about the next rate action by US Fed.
Dinesh Rohira, founder, 5nance.com, suggests investors wait for the outcome of the June 14 Fed meet.
"Any unexpected move by the US Fed may have impact on bond yields here," he says.
What should debt investors do then?
Gopalan suggests investors stick to dynamic bond funds which have the ability to switch actively between long and short term instruments depending on the market situation.
This makes it easier for investors as they need not worry about interest rate changes.
The rigid nature of gilt funds, on the other hand, requires that the investor time both the entry and exit from the fund.
