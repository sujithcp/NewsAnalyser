NEW DELHI: Use of Hindi in higher judiciary has not been made compulsory so far due to negative feedback from the Chief Justice of India, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said today.
Rijiju said in the Lok Sabha that currently Hindi is being used in high courts in four states -- Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.
"However, use of Hindi in Supreme Court and other High Courts has not been made compulsory due to negative feedback from the Chief Justice of India.
The issue has not moved forward since then," he said during Question Hour.
Replying to a supplementary that Hindi is not used in Patna High Court, Rijiju said if that was the case, it was a serious matter and the MPs of the state should take up the issue with the Governor and the Chief Minister of Bihar.
The Minister said government is in favour of promotion and expansion of Hindi and all other regional languages.
He said the department of official language receives complaints regarding reply given in English to communications received in Hindi off and on by central government organisations.
As per the received data, 99.4 per cent letters received in Hindi have been replied to in Hindi only.
Therefore, the cases of violation are negligible.
Similarly some complaints have been received in the department regarding issuance of press release in English only, he said.
Rijiju said such complaints are forwarded to the administrative head of the concerned organisation for action as per rules.
