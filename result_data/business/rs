“The stock has corrected 30% in the last one year on account of policy headwinds as a result of Kerala’s proposed liquor ban (staggered ban) and more recently by Tamil Nadu (key political parties in the state have promised prohibition if voted to power).
Prohibition on liquor was implemented in Bihar in April-16 as the ruling party fulfilled its promise made during the elections,” the brokerage house said in a report dated May 4, 2016.
“Despite the near-term negative news flow related to policy actions by various state governments, our positive long-term investment thesis on United Spirits remains intact, in view of its improved portfolio mix and resulting margin expansion, debt reduction with further divestment of non-core assets, better capital discipline, improved corporate governance and cost containment,” added report.
