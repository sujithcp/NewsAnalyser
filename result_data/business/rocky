Moments after the Gaya Police claimed that Janata Dal (United) MLC Manorama Devi's son Rocky Yadav confessed to shooting dead a teenager for overtaking his SUV, the main accused offered a contradictory statement and said that he never fired any shots nor was he in hiding.
When asked the police have said that he has confessed to the crime, Rocky said, "Just because someone says it does not make it true and it is also false that I was in hiding as I was in Delhi.
My mother called me to come here and then I surrendered before the police."
Asserting that he would disclose his side of the story in court, Rocky reiterated that he never fired any shots at the youth, which comes as a contradiction to the statement by Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Garima Malik, who claimed that the JD(U) leader's son has admitted to committing the crime.
"In his statement, Rocky Yadav admitted committing the crime.
I assure you that we will soon arrest others involved in the case.
The investigation will reveal about his whereabouts and these things would be addressed later on," Malik told the media.
"We got information of Rocky being in Bodh Gaya and he was arrested.
Anyone, who was trying to hide him, will be taken to task.
In our investigation, it was not found that he was drunk.
We will consider this angle also.
A raid was conducted in Manorama Devi's residence and some liquor bottles were recovered.
A separate case will be registered," she said.
Rakesh Yadav alias Rocky, the main accused in the alleged murder of teenager Aditya Sachdeva in a road rage case, was arrested in the wee hours today.
The police said that he was hiding inside a construction company office when the Special Task Force (STF) sleuths raided the place at 4 a.m.
The arrest took place a day after Rocky's mother was interrogated.
The youth was shot dead in Gaya on Saturday night allegedly because the son of JD (U) MLC was irked with the teenager for overtaking his SUV.
Aditya, a businessman's son, had recently given his Class 12 exams, was in his Swift car with his friends when he overtook the Range Rover belonging to the family of Manorama Devi.
Rocky was travelling in the SUV with a security guard who has said that the bullet that hit Aditya was fired from the personal revolver of the politician's son.
