The NGT order was on a public interest suit by a group called Social Action for Environment (SAFE).
It had cited media reports that 33 of the 35 distilleries making ethanol in Uttar Pradesh (UP) lacked the licence for storage of hazardous chemicals.
NGT has ruled that distilleries will have to abide by the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989, and the Chemical Accidents (Emergency Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996, both framed under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.
Industry insiders say even the trucks used to transport the ethanol don’t have a licence.
“The distilleries also do not have proper safety precautions in place to offset major accidents on site,” said Salik Shafique, lawyer for SAFE.
He alleged a labourer had been killed in an accident at a UP distillery; the state is the largest producer of sugar.
The application has dragged the state governments of major sugar producing states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra to answer for the lack of regulations in handling such cases.
NGT has also questioned the Central Pollution Control Board and the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation for not strictly enforcing laws in this regard.
Two weeks have been given for all the parties to reply.
To meet the five per cent national target for blending with petrol, the OMCs need 1,330 million litres of ethanol a year.
For the upcoming 10 per cent blending, double this much.
Since grain-based ethanol is not allowed, OMCs are fully dependent for procurement from sugar mills, for which the green fuel is a by-product.
The government also does not allow import of ethanol.
In March, the government stated that against the tender floated by OMCs for their year's requirement, offers totalling 1,200 million litres of ethanol had been received.
One more Expression of Interest has been floated to procure the remaining quantity, it said.
The five per cent blending programme was begun in 2013, to bring down the oil import bill and promote greener fuel options.
It is only now, after three years, that the target would be met by the end of the ongoing sugar year this September.
Indian Sugar Mills Association says of the NGT order: “It is going to adversely impact not only the industry on which several lakhs of workers and millions of farmers are dependent but also the cane farmers whose payments will get delayed because a massive quantity of ethanol and molasses will get stuck.”
Order passed in response to PIL citing media reports that 33 of 35 distilleries making ethanol in UP lacked licence for storage of hazardous chemicals
Monday's order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for sugar mills without an explosives licence to cease ethanol production will hit the oil marketing companies (OMCs) programme for blending ethanol with petrol.The NGT order was on a public interest suit by a group called Social Action for Environment (SAFE).
