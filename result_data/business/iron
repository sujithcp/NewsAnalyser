Government-owned mining major NMDC has cut iron ore prices of fines (with low Fe content) by 11% for May to align prices with global markets.
The company has also cut high grade iron ore (lumps) prices by 4% to encourage domestic steel mills to procure the raw material from it.
With this revision, iron ore fine is now quoted at Rs 1660 a tonne for May as compared to Rs 1860 a tonne for April.
Similarly, iron ore lump is now sold at Rs 2000 a tonne effective May 4 as against Rs 2100 a tonne earlier.
Over the last few months, India’s largest iron ore public sector miner NMDC has maintained high prices.
But its demand has slumped of late, resulting into large quantity of inventories at mine heads in Odisha.
Production obstruction in Karnataka, meanwhile, has resulted into lower availability of iron ore. “NMDC’s cut in iron ore prices can be attributed to weak demand and abundance of supply in domestic markets.
The company maintained higher price for several months though,” said Tarang Bhanushali, a steel analyst with India Infoline.
The latest price revision shows a marginal increase so far this calendar year from its January level of Rs 1560 a tonne of fines and Rs 1800 a tonne of lumps, reflecting thereby the prevailing trend in global markets.
The benchmark iron ore prices for delivery in China slumped by 9.28% in April to end the month at $60.09 a tonne.
