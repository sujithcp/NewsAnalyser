Indian Railways has abolished the dual freight rate policy for transportation of iron ore in a bid to boost freight traffic volumes and responding to a long-standing demand from the industry for uniform rates.Currently, transportation of iron ore meant for exports attracts a freight rate which is Rs 300 per tonne more than the rate for domestic use in steel and cement industries.
The dual rate policy had fuelled diversion of the ore meant for domestic use to exports.
“The dual freight policy applicable for transportation of iron ore and iron ore pellets is discontinued.
All types of iron ore and iron ore pellets, whether meant for domestic consumption for manufacture of iron and steel as well as cement or meant for other than domestic consumption, will now be charged at Class-165 (Trainload),” the rail ministry said in a circular.
The new freight rates came into effect on Tuesday and will remain in force till 31 March 2017.
The move is part of the larger reform measures unveiled by the rail ministry to ramp up falling freight volumes.
The Comptroller and Auditor general of India (CAG) had in May 2015 observed the government lost Rs 29,000 crore over five years as a result of the dual rate policy, unearthing the iron ore freight scam.
India produced 135 million tonne iron ore in 2015-16 as compared to 129 million tonne in the previous fiscal (2014-15).
Production has started picking up after years of decline on the back of allegations of large scale illegal mining in principal producing states leading to ban on mining.
The ban was partially lifted in Goa by the Supreme Court in 2014.
Thanks to a major slump in demand amid supply glut in major producing nations, the global iron ore prices have crashed to a third of their value a year ago.
The price slump had added to the woes of the industry already grappling with high freight rates for exports.
The domestic industry has also been demanding total abolition of the export duty on iron ore.
The Union Budget 2016-17 had removed export duty on low grade iron ore lumps with iron content of less than 58%.
