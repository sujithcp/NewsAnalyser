A Bhubaneswar-bound aircraft of Vistara with 50 passengers and seven crew on board was hit by a bird on Thursday shortly before landing at the Biju Patnaik International Airport.
The Airbus A320 aircraft, however, landed safely and no passengers are hurt.
“Vistara flight UK 709 Delhi to Bhubaneswar this morning experienced a bird hit on approach and continued to a safe landing at Biju Patnaik International Airport.
All 50 passengers and seven crew on board our Airbus 320 aircraft are safe,” Vistara said in a statement.
The aircraft is grounded at the Bhubaneswar airport where engineers are assessing the damage to the plane, they said, adding that the incident took place some 70km from the Bhubaneswar airport.
The airline, a Tata-SIA joint venture, said the bird-hit aircraft is expected to be released for operations later on Thursday.
“There are, however, no cancellations as of now though the return Bhubaneswar-Delhi leg is delayed until the engineering work is complete.”
