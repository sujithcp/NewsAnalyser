 
KHALID AL-FALIH is a busy man.
When he met The Economist in Riyadh in April, he was sitting in the sprawling office from which he was running the health ministry.
But the subject was the part-privatisation of Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, whose board he also chairs.
And then there was the big football match—Manchester City v Real Madrid—to rush home to watch.
Since then his focus has narrowed a little.
On May 7th the 55-year-old was moved from the health ministry to what had been known as the oil ministry, but is being renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.
That gives him oversight of the kingdom’s ambitious drive to take its economy beyond oil.
It also makes him the de facto head of OPEC, the oil cartel.
He is only the fifth person to head the ministry, after legendary predecessors such as Ali al-Naimi, who kept prices from rocketing during the second Gulf war, and Zaki Yamani, who devised the Arab oil embargo of 1973.
Those men were defined chiefly by their influence over OPEC, and hence over global oil markets.
Mr Falih will hope for a different legacy.
Speculation is already rife that his appointment marks the start of a new Saudi push to pump more oil.
The abrupt removal of Mr Naimi follows his effort last month to forge an agreement to freeze oil production between OPEC and non-OPEC producers such as Russia—an effort that was foiled by Muhammad bin Salman, the deputy crown prince.
King Salman’s son, and the power behind the throne, saw no reason to freeze output unless Iran, the kingdom’s strategic rival, did likewise.
Shortly afterwards Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive, cheered oil-price bears by saying the company would raise output by 250,000 barrels a day from its Shaybah oilfield.
But Mr Falih (pictured) comes across as too measured to create uproar.
Although Prince Muhammad calls the shots, it is possible that he will listen to the soft-spoken, Texas-educated technocrat who has been in the oil industry longer than the 30-year-old prince has been alive.
The new minister may want to expand Saudi Arabia’s output, but not so much to intensify the price war as to give himself the capacity to respond to seasonal surges in domestic demand and to fend off competition from Iran and Iraq to export to China and India.
Mr Falih says Saudi Arabia will look at the “most responsive ways” to meet its customers’ needs.
For instance, it typically sells oil through long-term contracts, but recently made its first spot sale in response to Asian demand.
What is more, shaping the global oil market may become less of a priority because Mr Falih has a huge new responsibility at home: preparing an initial public offering of Aramco.
He is also in charge of plans to develop domestic refining, petrochemicals and other industries and to boost the production of renewable energy.
This will require big improvements in the rule of law and corporate governance—not Saudi Arabia’s strengths.
Prince Muhammad says he is agnostic about oil prices, because his aim is to move beyond oil.
Whether or not he achieves that, Mr Falih’s focus will be beyond OPEC.
