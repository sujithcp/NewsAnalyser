Zampa (6-19) was the pick of the bowlers for Pune but his 6-for went in vain as Rising Pune Supergiants fell 4 runs short of the target in their run chase.
First Zampa dismissed a dangerous looking Yuvraj Singh to put brakes on the scoring and later in the 20th over the leggie dismissed Deepak Hooda (14), Naman Ojha (7) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1) to claim a brilliant six wicket-haul.
