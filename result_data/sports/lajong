Former champion Mohun Bagan runs into the challenge of a youthful Shillong Lajong FC as it seeks to regain the Federation Cup crown after a gap of eight years.
The two meet in the first leg of the tournament’s semifinals at the Vidyasagar Stadium, Barasat, on Sunday.
Bagan was in fine form and thoroughly efficient in securing a 7-2 aggregate against Salgaocar SC.
Lajong had to toil hard to overcome East Bengal 4-3 in aggregate.
When Bagan coach Sanjoy Sen was asked whether the quarterfinal results had given his team the ‘favourite’ tag, Sen said, “On current form, Lajong are stronger than East Bengal.
They defeated East Bengal twice and the last draw (the 2-2 result in the second leg) was as good as a victory.
It will be a tough challenge and we will have to be careful.”
Aware of fans’ title expectations, he said the match would be tougher than expected.
“You cannot score three to four goals every day.
We have to maintain a clean sheet and look to hold on to whatever we score,” Sen said.
Unlike the previous outings, where injuries had been a concern, Sen will have the full squad at his disposal in this match.
The host will thus look to create a sufficient cushion before progressing to the hills in Shillong, where Lajong is a big threat.
Lajong coach Thangboi Singto harped on the energy of his youthful side.
Singhto hoped the excellent camaraderie among his players would dilute the apparent notion of superiority that Bagan enjoys.
“I wish Bagan had only Sony Norde.
But, they also have Jeje Lalpekhlua, Katsumi Yusa, Cornell Glen and others.
I don’t think we have any advantage as we will be playing the home game later.
We have good camaraderie in the team and that is getting translated on the field,” the Lajong coach said.
Lajong will miss defender Robin Guring, who is serving a suspension for being red-carded against East Bengal.
