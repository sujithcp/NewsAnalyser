Shashank Manohar’s resignation as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president has thrown open the door for aspiring candidates in the BCCI.
As things stand, Anurag Thakur is the front-runner to be elevated from secretary to president.
Thakur’s promotion would leave the secretary’s post vacant.
Rajeev Shukla, chairman of the IPL governing council, is interested in holding the prestigious post, but Manohar is understood to have suggested Ajay Shirke’s name.
“I haven’t had any formal or informal approach or discussion about this with anyone in the Board,” Shirke told The Hindu from the United Kingdom.
“Shashank’s resignation at such a time is unfortunate.
If I am required to shoulder any responsibilities, I shall consider it after discussing with my colleagues in the Board.”
Shirke resigned as treasurer in May 2013, protesting against the BCCI’s inaction after Chennai Super Kings official and son-in-law of N. Srinivasan, Gurunath Meiyappan was arrested for alleged involvement in the IPL corruption scandal.
Despite Shirke’s resignation midway through his tenure, the BCCI corridors acknowledge the manner in which the treasurer’s office was streamlined during the Pune-based businessman’s reign.
Shirke’s detractors feel he won’t be a hands-on office-bearer, considering he spends more than half of the year in Europe handling family business.
However, Shirke doesn’t see it as a problem.
“In today’s age, one can be accessible all the time.
You don’t have to be present in the BCCI office, as long as you are accessible and you put an effective system in place,” he said.
Besides Shirke and Shukla, a section of BCCI members has been mooting Sourav Ganguly’s name.
