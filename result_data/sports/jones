Lizzie Jones sang at last year's Challenge Cup final at WembleyBBC's Songs of Praise is searching for supporters to sing in the Rugby League Challenge Cup Fans' Choir at Wembley.
A 32-strong choir will be selected from supporters representing clubs in this season's Challenge Cup to sing 'Abide With Me' before the final on 27 August.
The competition will be launched at half time of Saturday's sixth-round tie between Castleford Tigers and Salford Red Devils on BBC One (14:00 BST).
Further coverage comes during Sunday's episode of Songs of Praise on BBC One.
The judging panel will include Songs of Praise presenter Aled Jones, West End star Connie Fisher, Leeds Rhinos and England player James Jones-Buchanan and Lizzie Jones - who sang before last year's final in memory of husband Danny Jones.
Songs of Praise producer Matthew Napier said: "We want to hear your uplifting and unusual stories about supporting your club and why you think you deserve a place representing your team in the Rugby League Challenge Cup Fans' Choir."
