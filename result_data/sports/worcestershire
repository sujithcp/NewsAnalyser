Heavy rain on the final day in Cardiff meant Glamorgan and Worcestershire had to settle for a draw.
A resumption was scheduled for 13:55 BST but the rain returned while the players were still warming up.
Only 140.2 overs were bowled in the match, notable for Brett D'Oliveira becoming the third generation of his family to hit a double hundred.
Both teams will be back in action on Sunday, Glamorgan at Gloucestershire and Worcestershire at home to Sussex.
Worcestershire have now lost 729 overs out of a possible 1,536 this season, with no play on six entire days.
