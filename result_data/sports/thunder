Dan Ryan was assistant at Adelaide Thunderbirds before joining Manchester ThunderAustralian Dan Ryan took charge of Thunder in June 2015 after Tracey Neville's departure to take on the England head coach role.
It's been an impressive first campaign where Thunder lost just once during the regular season and sat six points clear going into the play-offs.
"Coming here to Manchester and coaching Thunder has been one of the best experiences of my life," Ryan told BBC Sport.
"The six months I've been here have flown by.
I've thoroughly enjoyed the city life of Manchester and working with the great athletes at Thunder.
"The only thing we want to do at the weekend is win the title and share the experience together."
Having finished second in the regular season, England international Pamela Cookey says reaching another final is an "amazing" achievement for the club,
"I know it's going to be an exciting game, and I'm really excited to be playing in it," the 31-year-old told BBC Sport.
"Thunder have been really consistent this year and have only lost one game, but anything can happen in a final.
"I think it'll be a very good game.
We've had good games over the season and I think it'll be a good one to end the season."
