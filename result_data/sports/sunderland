Kone’s brace helps the team beat Everton 3-0 and survive
Newcastle United and Norwich City were relegated from the Premier League on Wednesday as Sunderland secured its survival with a one-sided 3-0 victory over Everton.
Sunderland centre-back Lamine Kone’s first two goals for the club and a Patrick van Aanholt free-kick took Sam Allardyce’s side four points clear of danger with one game remaining.
Norwich returned to the Championship a year after promotion despite a 4-2 win over Watford, while Newcastle, Sunderland’s arch rival, will play in the second tier for the first time since 2010.
It is the fourth season in a row that Sunderland has pulled off a late escape to avoid relegation and it guarantees the northeast club top-flight football for a 10th consecutive season.
Allardyce was the architect of its surge to safety, succeeding the sacked Dick Advocaat in October and overseeing a late-season run that has seen it take 11 points from a possible 15.
Sunderaland went ahead when Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles misjudged Van Aanholt’s 38th-minute free-kick, moving to his left and allowing the ball to bounce straight past him.
Kone made it 2-0 four minutes later, volleying in emphatically after Sunderland failed to clear a corner, and smashed in his second in the 55th minute when Robles spilled Wahbi Khazri’s corner.
The result also served to increase the pressure on Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose 12th-place side has won just one of its last 10 league matches.
Alex Neil’s Norwich got the better of Watford in a ding-dong contest at Carrow Road, but Sunderland’s win meant that it would have been relegated regardless.
The results: Liverpool 1 (Benteke 90+2) drew with Chelsea 1 (Hazard 32).
Norwich 4 (Redmond 15, Mbokani 18, 57, Cathcart 37-og) bt Watford 2 (Deeney 11, Ighalo 51).
Sunderland 3 (Van Aanholt 38, Kone 42, 55) bt Everton 0.
