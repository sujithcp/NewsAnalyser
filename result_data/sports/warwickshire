Warwickshire's Championship game with Somerset was abandoned as a draw after a second washed-out day at Edgbaston.
After no play in the morning session, the rain stopped and the sky brightened during the scheduled lunch interval.
Somerset, in particular, were hoping that play would follow, needing 10 wickets to win, with the home side facing a target of 318.
But following a post-lunch inspection, match umpires Ian Gould and Neil Mallender called it off.
The two sides, who both remain unbeaten after four matches, are back in action again on Sunday.
Somerset host reigning county champions Yorkshire at Taunton, while Warwickshire visit Trent Bridge to face Nottinghamshire.
Bears skipper Ian Bell is still hopeful of being fit, despite nursing a hamstring injury.
