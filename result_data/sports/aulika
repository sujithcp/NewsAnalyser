Halani Aulika scored two tries in 24 appearances for London Irish this seasonPremiership side Sale Sharks have signed prop Halani Aulika from relegated London Irish.
The 32-year-old Tongan has spent four seasons with the Exiles after joining from Leeds in 2012.
He featured for Auckland and Otago in New Zealand and also played once for Super Rugby side Highlanders.
"I have been watching Aulika all season and when his agent got in touch I didn't hesitate in signing him," said director of rugby Steve Diamond.
"He is a great scrummager and puts himself about on the pitch.
I am sure he will be a big asset for us next season and beyond."
Sale have also announced that England Under-18 internationals and twin brothers Tom and Ben Curry have signed their first professional contracts with the club.
