In the second round of the Italian F4 championship, Kush Maini secured a rookie podium finish in all his three races to top the rookie driversâ€™ championship with 91 points.
In the first race, Kush finished seventh, starting eighth, and took the second place among rookies, securing his first podium of the weekend.
In the second race, Kush held position starting seventh and finished just outside of the rookie podium places.
But, an incorrect classification of one of the drivers above him as a rookie proved lucky for him because the penalty awarded to that driver pushed Kush up the grid to give him the third place on the rookie podium and he ended up sixth overall.
With two solid performances in the qualifying races, Kush locked a place in the final race that saw him come up with a smooth drive and round off the weekend holding his starting position of 10th but finished second on the rookie podium.
