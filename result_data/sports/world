Japan fans celebrate a try against USA at the 2015 World CupThe draw for the 2019 World Cup in Japan will be made in May 2017.
The draw for the 2015 World Cup was held in December 2012, almost three years before the tournament.
Wales' ranking dropped to ninth shortly before the draw, meaning they were drawn against England and Australia.
By the time of the tournament, Wales were ranked fifth - one place higher than England.
World Rugby said: "While the draw is closer to the start of the tournament this time around compared to the previous Rugby World Cup, it is necessary to conduct it well in advance for logistical reasons and to allow for an effective ticketing programme to be implemented."
The tournament will take place between 20 September and 2 November 2019.
