Bradford are currently third in the ChampionshipChampionship side Bradford Bulls have appointed Rohan Smith as their new head coach on a three-year deal.
The 35-year-old has left his assistant coach role at NRL side Gold Coast Titans to join the club his father Brian coached between 1995 and 1996.
He has worked at a number of clubs including Penrith Panthers, Sydney Roosters and New Zealand Warriors, as well as being head coach of Tonga.
"I've had a long affinity with the Bulls with my Dad and it was great to be a part of it watching on from the stands," Smith told the club website.
"I was fortunate enough to start coaching at a young age and my path has been a bit different to the path which most coaches take."
Bradford are currently third in the Championship, seven points behind leaders Leigh Centurions with a game in hand.
