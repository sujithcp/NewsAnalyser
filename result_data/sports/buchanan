Jack Buchanan has played 41 games for Wests TigersWidnes have signed prop Jack Buchanan from National Rugby League side Wests Tigers on an 18-month deal that runs until the end of the 2017 season.
Buchanan, 24, made his first-grade debut for Wests in 2013 and has made 41 NRL appearances, although a foot injury limited him to two games this term.
Wests have agreed to his release but the deal is subject to visa approval.
"This is a great opportunity to come up for me halfway through the year," Buchanan said.
"I have been watching the team when I can.
They don't air all games over here but they look like an exciting bunch of players that I can't wait to get over and work with.
"Charly Runciman is a big part of why I am coming to the Vikings.
I played with him for two years when I was younger and speaking to him has made me really excited to get over."
The former St George-Illawarra junior will join up with Denis Betts' side and adds to the front-row options, including Eamon O'Carroll, Manase Manuokafoa, Gil Dudson, Alex Gerrard and the Chapelhow brothers Ted and Jay.
"Jack is a young big front rower with a great engine," Betts said.
"He has significant NRL experience and is ready to make his mark, looking to establish himself as a starting front rower and wants to do that here at Widnes.
"This is a big statement from us as a Club.
Jack is an enthusiastic player that wants to come here and progress his career making himself into a better player."
