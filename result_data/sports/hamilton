Lewis Hamilton will recover from his current second place in the championship and mount a strong challenge to win his fourth world title this year, starting with this weekend’s Spanish Grand Prix.
That is the view of both his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, who leads him by 34 points after four races, and the champion team which is determined to put Hamilton’s problem-hit start to the season behind them.
“We feel badly for Lewis because we’ve let him down, in terms of his competition with Nico,” said Mercedes technical chief Paddy Lowe.
The three-time champion is without a win this year and has suffered a string of disappointments with a series of engine problems and first lap incidents in races.
He is without a victory since winning in the United States last year.
In that time, Rosberg has been triumphant and has reeled off four straight wins this season to lift him clear at the top of the title race.
But even after seven wins in succession, the German has admitted to knowing that Hamilton’s ferocious competitive spirit and raw speed is sure to return and make him a winner again.
Rosberg won last year’s race at the Circuit de Catalunya from pole position as Hamilton did the season before, a sequence that is expected to continue for Mercedes on a track that tends to deliver somewhat soporific contests.
Knowledge of the circuit
The teams know the circuit well from winter testing and there are few surprises other than updates that fail, or work well, as the European part of the 21-race season is launched in earnest.
For many, the chief topic of interest will be to see how Dutch teenager Max Verstappen copes with the pressure of expectation after his sudden promotion from Toro Rosso to replace Russian Daniil Kvyat in the senior Red Bull team.
