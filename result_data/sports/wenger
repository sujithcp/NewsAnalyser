Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played 33 times for Arsenal this seasonEngland winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been ruled out of this summer's European Championship after suffering his second knee injury of the season.
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the 22-year-old, capped 24 times, will be out for a further six to eight weeks.
"There is no chance of the Euros for him," said Wenger.
"He will be back at the beginning of July."
Oxlade-Chamberlain, who made his England debut against Norway in 2012, had been scheduled to feature for the Gunners' Under-21 side earlier this week.
"He was out for a while and was not overloaded with games," Wenger added.
"You want a guy of 22 years of age to go to the European Championship, so it is very sad."
