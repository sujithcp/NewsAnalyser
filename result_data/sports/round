Britain's Johanna Konta is through to the Italian Open second round following a 6-1 6-2 win over Sweden's Johanna Larsson.
British number one Konta, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open this year, served eight aces on the way to knocking out the Swedish qualifier.
The 24-year-old will face Italy's Roberta Vinci in the next round.
Fellow Briton Heather Watson had already made it through with a win over world number 18 Sara Errani on Monday.
