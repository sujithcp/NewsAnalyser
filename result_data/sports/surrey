Steve Davies hit his first County Championship century of the season as Surrey dominated Yorkshire's bowlers for much of day one at Headingley.
Davies (117) and Kumar Sangakkara (73) helped Surrey recover from 38-2 to 160-3 with a 122-run partnership.
Yorkshire hit back, as Liam Plunkett (2-77) forced Sangakkara to edge to slip, before Davies chipped to cover.
Surrey were bowled out for 330 before Adam Lyth and Alex Lees saw out two overs to leave Yorkshire 15-0.
Yorkshire made early inroads as Rory Burns (12) edged David Willey (3-55) through to Jonny Bairstow and Arun Harinath (12) was dropped three times before hitting Plunkett to cover.
Davies and Sangakkara marshalled Surrey's recovery on a pitch that offered some assistance to the bowlers, but the rest of their middle order could not build on their start.
Jason Roy fell for one to Jack Brooks (3-73) and Ben Foakes made a patient 48 before edging to slip as Surrey struggled with Yorkshire's accuracy.
Willey was on a hat-trick as he dismissed James Burke and Gareth Batty with the new ball, but Tom Curran's 32 helped Surrey past 300.
Surrey batsman Steve Davies told BBC Radio London:
"I had a pretty tough start in the first couple of games and I thought I got some good balls, but now we're moving in the right direction.
"Yorkshire made it really tough for the opening batters and fortunately for me, the ball was a little bit older when I got in.
"It wasn't a bad day but it could have been a great day.
We lost wickets before the second new ball which cost us today.
"There's a little bit in the wicket and we will have to bowl well tomorrow and stay patient."
