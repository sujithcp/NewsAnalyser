A book by former woman footballer Sona Chaudhary has re-ignited the issue of sexual harassment in Indian sport.
The book — Game In Game , released recently — highlights the subject that has shown the ugly side of sport time and again.
Sona has alleged that coaches and officials have been indulging in sexual harassment of women footballers from the time she was an active member of the Indian team.
She was part of the squad that participated in the 1998 Asian Cup before injury brought an early end to her career.
Former women’s national coach Anadi Barua said such incidents hurt the image of the game hugely.
“Not all coaches are immoral.
I have been with the women’s team for two years and I can assure you that all steps are taken to ensure that players are well protected.
“Such incidents put us (coaches) in a humiliating spot.
Obviously, harsh punishment to such offenders are needed,” said Barua.
Reacting to the allegations, Union Sports Minister Sarbanand Sonowal assured that, if there were complaints, steps would be taken to deal with the matter strictly.
