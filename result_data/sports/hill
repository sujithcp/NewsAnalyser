Jessica Ennis-Hill tore a calf muscle while winning the world title in 2015Olympic and world heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill has pulled out of June's meeting in Gotzis, Austria.
The 30-year-old has not recovered from a recurrence of an Achilles tendon problem that forced her out of the World Indoor Championships in March.
She was due to go up against fellow Britons Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake, who are looking to achieve the Olympic qualifying standard.
Ennis-Hill has already secured her place in Rio.
However, missing the Gotzis meeting - one of the most prestigious on the heptathlon calendar - denies her the chance to assess her form, and that of her rivals, before the defence of her Olympic title in August.
