Finding sponsors and making it to the grid every season is the most difficult path for a biker.
Rajini Krishnan, who will be defending his Malaysian superbike championship title this month, is raising funds through crowd-funding site ketto.org/rajinikrishnan to compete in the event.
“So far my fans and friends have been sponsoring my trips.
Overall, I need Rs.
16 lakhs.
I am hoping to get four lakhs from ketto.org .
It will be great if the corporates step in for the remaining amount,” Rajini said.
The talented driver has also got an offer from Spain to compete in the Spanish superbike championships.
“For the Spanish trip, I need Rs.
1.3 crore.
If things go well, I will be able to compete in Spain,” he said.
