Giles Scott will represent Team GB in the Finn class at the OlympicsBritain's Giles Scott claimed his fourth world title with victory in the Finn Gold Cup in Gaeta, Italy.
Scott, who will represent Team GB at Rio 2016, becomes the regatta's second most successful sailor - behind four-time Olympic champion Sir Ben Ainslie.
After a bad start on day one, the 28-year-old now has an unassailable lead over Dane Jonas Hogh-Christensen before Friday's final race.
"That sends a bit of a message out," said Scott.
"To win any World Championship is massive, but to win the one three months out from the Games is great.
"Ultimately anything can happen at the Games, but at the moment we are happy with where we are at and we just want to take the form we have forwards."
Scott only has to finish the medal race to confirm his title.
