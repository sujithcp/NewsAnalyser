Gujarat Lions coach Brad Hodge said there were quite a few “areas of concern” in the side and was particularly miffed with the tendency of his spinners to bowl no balls at crucial junctures.
The Lions lost their second successive game on Tuesday night, against Delhi Daredevils, though they continue to top the points table.
“If you are 3 for 20, losing three of your best batters upfront, you’re going to be in trouble.
Same (as) what happened the last game,” Hodge said.
“In the last game against Kings, Axar (Patel) took a hat-trick.
Couple of balls didn’t even turn.
We lost three wickets in an over.
And again (today), three wickets in seven balls with three of our best batters.
Wickets in powerplay...something that we need to look at,” the Aussie said after Lions’ eight-wicket defeat at home.
Hodge was peeved at how no balls cost his side dear.
“Unforgivable, unforgivable” he said.
When Ravindra Jadeja overstepped to reprieve Sanju Samson, who was stumped in the 16th over, it was the second such let-off in three games.
“Who knows what could’ve happened if that was given out for Sanju.
Next ball he gets a free hit, the ball goes for a boundary, game over.
If you’re just going to let your guard down for a moment, you’re going to be found out.
Hopefully, we can dust ourselves off and adjust with the differences and indifferences that we have and come again strongly.
I would certainly hope that these last two games hurt very much.”
Hodge did not sound satisfied with the pitch at the team’s base.
“It was not ideal.
I must say the surface exactly wasn’t what we were looking for.
It is a little disappointing,” he said.
“This is your home ground, you expect a little bit better.
But having said that, you cannot use that as an excuse.
The opportunity was there.”
He backed his top-order but felt they could be a little careful in their shot selection.
“They are free spirited players.
They are natural stroke-players and I don’t want to certainly take that away from them,” he said.
“But we certainly just have to have a little watchful in our shot selection and adapt to the conditions a little bit better.
