Rome: Roger Federer was eliminated from the Italian Open on Thursday, losing to 15th-ranked Dominic Thiem 7-6 (2), 6-4 in the third round.
Federer withdrew from last week's Madrid Open with lower back pain and has only 10 days before the French Open begins.
Federer went up a break early in the first set but Thiem broke right back and Federer made little impact on the Austrian's serve the rest of the way, deciding not to run back to the middle of the court after a couple weak backhand returns.
At 22, Thiem is the youngest player in the top 20 of the rankings.
