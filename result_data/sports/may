New Delhi: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Gautam Gambhir recently came under severe criticism after he hit a chair in the dugout during the ongoing season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2016.
In a column for The New Indian Express, the Delhi batsman on Wednesday wrote that he committed a mistake by kicking the chair.
"Yes, I committed a mistake.
In hindsight, I shouldn't have kicked," he said.
While he confessed that he was embarrassed over the incident, at the same time he asked whether role models aren't entitled to have emotions?
"My brush with the authorities is not new.
While I am repentant and embarrassed, I have never got the answer to one very basic question: Aren't role models entitled to have emotions?
Aren't they human enough to express themselves or release their pent-up feelings?
I think they too are by-products of the times and the society they are living in.
It wasn't for the first time that the 34-year-old was involved in a controversy.
During a Ranji Trophy match last year, Gambhir, who is the captain of Delhi team, got into an ugly fight with his Bengal counterpart Manoj Tiwary.
He was involved in an ugly spat with Virat Kohli during one of the IPL matches in previous editions.
