Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan believes that newly-appointed head coach Mickey Arthur will have a successful stint with the national team.
After weeks of rumbling, PCB on Friday appointed former South African cricketer Mickey Arthur as the successor of Waqar Younis, who stepped down from the position following a disastrous World Twenty20 campaign in India last month.
Reflecting on the latest appointment, Shaharyar said Arthur had coached Karachi Kings in the inaugural edition of the Pakistan Super League which will help him in his new assignment, the Express Tribune reported.
His appointment was criticised by some as Arthur had earlier levelled match-fixing allegations against Pakistani players.
However, Shaharyar stated that it has become a dead issue now considering the fact that the South African has clarified them about his earlier statement.
Arthur had successfully coached his native South Africa from 2005-2010 before migrating to Australia, where he remained coach of the national team for 19 months.
Under his tutelage, the South African national team attained world number one rankings across all formats.
