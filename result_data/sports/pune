The odds are clearly stacked against MS Dhoni's Rising Pune Supergiants.
Their debut year in IPL has been far from satisfying.
Even if they can't qualify for the playoffs, Pune could still ruin a few dreams.
Sunrisers Hyderabad will surely be wary.
In their first meeting this season, RPS beat SRH by Duckworth-Lewis method.
The 36-run win in a low-scoring game in Hyderabad was largely fashioned by Steve Smith (36-ball 46 not out) and Faf du Plessis (21-ball 30).
Both Smith and Du Plessis are out of the tournament with injuries.
Pune, of course, have the personnel to fight.
Usman Khawaja and George Bailey are T20 specialists but need to justify their inclusion in the RPS side.
Ajinkya Rahane and Saurabh Tiwary have been RPS' best bets so far.
Coming off a hattrick of wins, SRH are looking a confident lot.
David Warner has led from the front, Shikhar Dhawan has played pressure-free cricket and Yuvraj Singh is contributing in the middle order.
But it's been their bowling that has scripted SRH's six wins out of nine matches.
The combined performance of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashish Nehra and Mustafizur Rahman has wrecked the best of batting teams.
The bowling will give SRH a handsome edge on Tuesday night in hot and humid Visakhapatnam.
