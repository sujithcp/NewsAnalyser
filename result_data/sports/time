Glasgow: World No.1 women's tennis star Serena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou has said nobody is surprised with men's No.3 Andy Murray's split from coach Amelie Mauresmo.
The two-time Grand Slam winner and Mauresmo ended their two-year partnership on Monday.
"Everyone knows everyone in the locker rooms and players' lounges," Mouratoglou was quoted as saying by the BBC on Tuesday.
"Obviously something was wrong."
Mouratoglou also poined out that Mauresmo was not present at the playerâ€™s box at the Miami Open in March where Murray exited in the third round.
In a joint statement about the end of their partnership, Mauresmo--who gave birth to her first child in August 2015, said "dedicating time and travel has been a challenge".
"We will all miss having her around," Murray stated.
Murray was earlier coached by Ivan Lendl, under whom he grabbed the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon titles.
"The only time in his career when he could find this extra thing to win those matches against the top three and win Slams, the Olympics, was when he was with Ivan," added Mouratoglou.
"But even if he's not able to make that little extra difference, with his level of play he should be most of the time in the top four."
