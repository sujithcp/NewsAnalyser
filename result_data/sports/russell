Kolkata, May 5: Describing himself as a "true all-rounder", Kolkata Knight Riders' ( KKR ) Andre Russell has revealed that he always aimed to bowl at 150 kilometres per hour and then smash big sixes.

The tall West Indian took 4 wickets for 20 runs including bowling the match-turning last over on Wednesday night.
With 12 required off the final over, Russell held his nerve to concede only 4 runs and took a wicket.
He won the Man-of-the-match award.
"It is the first time that I am wearing this purple cap and it feels good on my head.
I hope I can keep wearing it with a lot of pride," Russell, who is the joint highest wicket-taker now in IPL 2016 with 13 victims, told IPL's official website.
Mumbai Indians' Mitchell McClenaghan too has same number of wickets but Russell is the Purple Cap holder with a better economy rate.
Known for his big-hitting, Russell said he wanted to bowl fast, at 150 kmph and "hit the ball out of the ground".
"I am a true all-rounder and I aim to bowl at 150 kmph and then hit big sixes.
I want to hit the ball out of the ground.
You do have a lot of all-rounders who bowl at 130 kmph and mid 130s and can bat but I want to bowl fast.
"At the end of the day, a type of all-rounder like me is just trying to raise the bar as high as possible.
I have been watching a lot of all-rounders like Jacques Kallis and Shane Watson.
The motive is to be as complete as I can," he added.
