Andre Russell’s consistent all-round performance has been a key factor in Kolkata Knight Riders’ fine showing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) this season and the West Indian does not mind bending over backwards to help his team.
After scoring a 10-ball 16, picking up four wickets and effecting a run out in KKR’s narrow seven-run win over Kings XI Punjab at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday night, Man-of-the-match Russell said he enjoyed the workload.
“I know my job is not easy, it’s very hard.
Batting till the end and then bowling the first over.
I don’t mind doing it.
“As a youngster, I want to leave behind a legacy, set standards as high as possible,” said Russell.
“I love these challenges, enjoy bowling in the moments where I can win the game.
If it goes the other way, I learn from it and take the positives.”
Russell said he always played in the team’s interest.
“I don’t have any problem batting the last five overs.
No.
7 is good enough for a T20 game.
I’m a team man.
I’m just happy to be a part of this team.
Wherever the skipper needs me to go bat and bowl, I want to give 100 per cent.
I can’t complain.”
The 28-year-old Jamaican said playing with KKR helped him grow as a player.
“To be around with the likes of Jacques Kallis and Wasim Akram teaches me a few things about bowling.
It helps me hone my knowledge in terms of batting and bowling.”
Russell said off-spinner Sunil Narine did not play Wednesday’s match due to a finger injury in his right hand.
