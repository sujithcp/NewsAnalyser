Sir AP McCoy retired from racing in April 2015Jump racing legend Sir AP McCoy has been at Saracens, helping motivate the players for their end-of-season push.
The 20-time Champion Jockey visited the club's training ground on Tuesday, as Saracens prepare for the Champions Cup final and the Premiership play-offs.
"To get him in was a real coup for us," director of rugby Mark McCall said.
"For our group to listen to a 20-time Champion Jockey was incredible.
He spoke to the squad for an hour, and he was unbelievably engaging."
Saracens regularly invite guests speakers to address the players, but McCall says McCoy has long been someone the club's management have admired.
"AP McCoy was somebody we had talked about in meetings three years ago when he won his 17th title," McCall added to BBC Radio 5 live.
"To see the sacrifices he had gone through to achieve what he has achieved, and how driven he was to achieve that, was enlightening for everybody."
