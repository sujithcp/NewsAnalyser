Sushil Kumar wanted trials to decide who goes to Rio.
Narsingh won the Olympic quota for India in 74-kg category.
Sushil hasn't competed in 74 kg since 2014.
Historically, the wrestler who won the quota has gone on to represent India at the Games.
News Delhi: The impasse around India's representation in the 74-kg men's wrestling at the coming Rio Olympics in August got closer to resolution on Thursday as the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) confirmed they have recommended Narsingh Pancham Yadav, who won the 74-kg quota, in the list sent to Indian Olympic Association (IOA).
It was, however, widely debated whether the double Olympic medal-winner Sushil Kumar should be the man travelling to Brazil, but WFI has gone in favour of Narsingh whose bronze medal at the World Championships last year got India its first Olympic quota in wrestling.
We have sent the name of Narsingh Pancham Yadav to the IOA.
Now it's up to the IOA.
We have made our recommendation in the 74-kg category, Vinod Tomar, assistant secretary of the WFI, told News18 Sports.
Sushil, who had made a switch from 66 kg to 74-kg category, doesn't have much experience in the 74-kg category, which is probably why the federation went with Narsingh who has always been competing in this category.
Sushil won a bronze and silver in the 66-kg category at Beijing 2008 and London 2012 respectively.
He then made a switch to 74 kg in 2014 and won gold at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games; however, he hasn't competed since then, while Narsingh has been a regular in the 74-kg division.
But Sushil wanted trials to decide who would compete on the wrestling mat in Rio de Janeiro.
Historically, however, the wrestler who won the quota has gone on to represent the country at the Games, and the norm doesn't seem to be changing this time with the WFI dropping Sushil from the squad in favour of Narsingh.
"When we go for a competition abroad, we are selected for the team through a trial.
I took trials for a place at the World Championships.
I won bronze there.
I believe I should be given a direct entry to the Olympics," Narsingh told News18 in an interview earlier .
"I have been preparing at the national camp with the mindset of playing at the Olympics; and since I have won the quota place, a trial doesn't look good."
So far eight Indian wrestlers have qualified for the Rio Games, which is the most ever by India at any Olympics.
