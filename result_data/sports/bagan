Jeje Lalpekhlua fired a hat-trick as Mohun Bagan took a firm step towards sealing the final berth by blanking Shillong Lajong FC 5-0 in the first leg of the Hero Federation Cup semifinal here on Sunday.
Bikramjit Singh and substitute Azharuddin Mallick scored one apiece to accomplish one of the biggest winning margins for the city giant in recent times.
Bagan last beat Bengaluru FC by a similar margin to gain the I-League runner-up spot barely a couple of weeks ago.
The 13-time Fed Cup champion now travels to Shillong to play the away fixture on May 14.
Lajong now need to win by a clear margin of 6-0 at home if it fancies any chance of reaching the title round.
Mohun Bagan did well in preserving the dominance that marked its performance against Salgaocar FC in the quarterfinals, from where it progressed with a big 7-2 aggregate.
Banking on a youthful side that impressed with speed and fitness, the North-East giant started well, mounting relentless attack on the host.
But the absence of a good striker seemed to hamper the visitors’ offensive intent.
Lajong FC coach Tangboi Singto fielded the Brazilian attacking combination of Fabio Pena and Uilliams Souza Silva.
The latter had scored a late equaliser against East Bengal in the quarterfinals.
Mohun Bagan regrouped towards the end of the first-half, scoring two quick goals.
The Bagan attack came good riding on the skills of its Haitian World-Cupper Sony Norde, who opened the sluice gates with a brilliant assist in the 40th minute.
Jeje finished the move after Nordy had cleared the Lajong defence with a skilful run.
Norde’s first attempt was blocked by the Lajong goalkeeper Vishal Kaith but the India striker did well to follow till the end and slotted home the loose ball.
Bagan made it 2-0 by the 45th minute when Bikramjit Singh moved up from the midfield to avail a flick from the Trinidad and Tobago striker Cornell Glen.
Bagan continued the assault after the break and found another two by the 55th minute to virtually end Lajong’s hopes of making a comeback.
Bagan coach Sanjoy Sen found his overtly attacking arrangement — that is spun around the efficiency of Norde, Glen, Japanese Katsumi Yusa and Jeje — coming good once again as the four combined to find the third goal which the Indian finished in the 51st minute.
Jeje completed his hat-trick in the 55th minute when Bagan launched a perfect counter-attack to finish it with a goal.
As Lajong hoped for the barrage to stop, Azaharuddin Mallick, who replaced Geln late in the second-half, found the fifth, latching on to a precise back-centre from Norde.
The result: Mohun Bagan 5 (Jeje Lalpekhlua 40, 51, 55, Bikramjit Singh 45, Azharuddin Mallick 87) bt Shillong Lajong FC 0.
