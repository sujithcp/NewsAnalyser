Former Australia player Stuart Law has been confirmed as the Pakistan Cricket Board’s first choice for the post of national team chief coach.
Law was confirmed as the first choice candidate for the job at Tuesday’s Board of Governors meeting in Lahore in which South African Andy Moles was kept as a back-up.
Law, who is presently preparing for an assignment as batting consultant to the Australian team for the tour of Sri Lanka in July-August, submitted his application for the post of coach with the PCB before the April 25 deadline.
Law, who played one Test and 54 one-day internationals, has enjoyed success as a coach with his native Queensland side in the Sheffield Shield competition and with Essex and Lancashire in England.
The Australian has also had coaching stints with the Sri Lankan and Bangladesh teams.
Although PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan didn’t disclose the name of the chosen coach at a media conference, a member of the Board of Governors confirmed Law was the unanimous choice.
“Moles is the back-up as the PCB has to sort out some issues with Law because of his prior coaching commitments,” he told PTI .
Khan, however, confirmed that the BOG had selected the new coach but said his name would be officially announced in a few days as the board needed to complete negotiations with the candidate.
“We don’t want to make any announcement right now until the contract is signed as we are still talking to the candidate (s),” he said.
Pakistan coach’s position has been left vacant since Waqar Younis resigned last month after the team’s poor show in the Asia Cup and World T20.
Pakistan has in the past employed several foreign coaches including Richard Pybus, Bob Woolmer, Geoff Lawson and Dav Whatmore.
