Karachi: Pakistan's hunt for a new coach continues to face hurdles as their top choice -- Australian Stuart Law -- has turned down the position, expressing his inability to join the team immediately.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said it will try to convince Law or choose from Englishman Andy Moles and Australian Test batsman Dean Jones.
"Yes there are hurdles in the way of signing on Stuart Law as head coach although he is our first choice for this position," PCB Chairman, Shaharyar Khan told PTI.
"He had applied for a coaching position with us but he has now conveyed he is more interested in a consultant's position and that he wouldn't be able to join the team immediately," Khan said.
Law, a former Australian Test batsman, has already been signed by Cricket Australia as a batting consultant for the tour to Sri Lanka from July to September and apparently he has told the PCB he is also not available when Pakistan tours Australia in November-December this year.
Khan admitted that finding the right person for the job had become a tedious task for the board.
He also confirmed the board of governors unanimously picked Law as the first choice coach and Moles as second choice.
"We are now also talking to Moles and Jones although the BOG (Board of Governors) had some reservations over some candidates," the PCB chief said.
A reliable source in the board told PTI that the PCB were not certain about signing on Moles, 55, as yet because of his history as coach with associate teams like Kenya, Scotland, Afghanistan and Test side, New Zealand.
"What is of concern to us is that Moles left or had to leave coaching assignments with Kenya, Scotland, New Zealand and Afghanistan because of disagreements or discord with their boards or players," the source said.
Shaharyar Khan said negotiations were going on with prospective candidates and a final decision should be taken in next two to three days.
"We want the new coach to join the team before the tour to England from next month," he said.
"Once the head coach is appointed we will also finalise the rest of the support staff with him," he added.
