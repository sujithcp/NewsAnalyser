Even as Kolkata Knight Riders coach Jacques Kallis accompanied his players to enjoy a game of golf and lend support to charity work, he could not switch himself off completely from the thought of his team’s unfinished job in the Indian Premier League (IPL) this season.
“It cannot be all work and no pleasure,” said Kallis on the occasion of ‘Knight Golf’ at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) here on Thursday.
However, when he encountered questions about KKR’s journey so far, Kallis was all seriousness.
Positives “The positive, of course, is we are at the top of the table.
A negative might be we were pretty similar to this last year, then, sort of, relaxed towards the end.
“We are aware of that and, hopefully, we have learnt from it.
“We're working hard.
The way the guys are gelling together to get a balanced side, there is a lot of positives going forward.”
The South African praised his players for notching up a fantastic seven-run win over Kings XI Punjab the previous night at the Eden Gardens.
“It was a magnificent effort keeping in view that the guys were tired after a long trip.
It just showed their fighting spirit.
“Even though they were tired they managed to put up a big performance.
I am really proud of the way they have played so far.”
On KKR scheduled to play four home matches, Kallis said, “You still have to play good cricket.
“We can’t just sit back and expect that we will win at home.
However, it is nice to have that cushion.”
