Thousands of people turned out to celebrate Leicester City's promotion to the Premier League in 2014
A victory parade will be held to celebrate Leicester City's Premier League success on 16 May, the BBC understands.
It is believed the route will go from the King Power Stadium to the city centre before ending at a park.
The city council has refused to officially confirm any plans but previously said Town Hall Square was not big enough.

The 2014 route went along the High Street, past the Clock Tower and on to Town Hall Square
In 2014, the Foxes held an open top bus parade to celebrate promotion to the top flight after a 10-year absence.
Thousands of people lined the route from High Street, past the Clock Tower before about 6,000 fans greeted the buses in Town Hall Square.
City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has previously told the Leicester Mercury that too many people would want to celebrate to be able to hold anything in Town Hall Square again.
Leicester City will lift the Premier League trophy on Saturday at their last home match against Everton.
The parade is expected on 16 May, the day after Leicester's final game of the season at last season's champions Chelsea.
