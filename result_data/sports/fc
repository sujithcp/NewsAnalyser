In an unprecedented decision, Indian Super League side FC Goa were on Thursday slapped a whopping fine of Rs 11 crore while their co-owners Shrinivas Dempo and Dattaraj Salgaocar were banned for two and three seasons respectively for "bringing disrepute" to the tournament.
The ISL Regulatory Commission took the decisions after the conclusion of the hearings in Mumbai relating to the controversy surrounding the scuffle between Chennaiyin FC's Brazillian marquee player Elano Blumer and FC Goa officials after the ISL second season final in Margao in December last.
The five-member Regulatory Commission of ISL headed by Justice (Retd) D A Mehta met in Mumbai over last three days in continuation of their earlier sittings since February to hear the submissions of the respective parties in the matter of Football Sports Development Limited vs FC Goa; FC Goa vs Chennaiyin FC; FC Goa vs Elano Blumer and Chennaiyin FC vs FC Goa.
"In its final order pronounced today, FC Goa were found in breach of ISL regulations/code of conduct bringing disrepute to the ISL, following the unfortunate incident on 20th December 2015 soon after the Hero ISL final at Fatorda Stadium, Goa.
FC Goa were facing the allegations of violating ISL Regulations namely for 'boycotting match and league ceremony', 'public criticism and threatening match officials,' 'alleging that the match were fixed,' and 'non-adherence of League rules'," the ISL said in a release.
"Mr. Dattaraj Salgaocar shall be banned from associating with any activity pertaining to ISL matches (including entering stadium) for three (3) ISL seasons.
Mr. Srinivas Dempo shall be banned from associating with any activity pertaining to ISL matches (including entering stadium) for two (2) ISL seasons.
"A sum of Rs 10 crore (Rupees Ten Crores Only) shall be paid by FC Goa to FSDL towards penalty/fine as well as costs; and a sum of Rs 1 crore (Rupees One Crore Only) shall be paid by FC Goa to Chennaiyin FC towards costs," the release said.
Dempo is also a vice-president of the All India Football Federation.
FC Goa team will also be docked 15 points in the next ISL season.
The Regulatory Commission members were unanimous in arriving at the verdict.
Besides Justice (Retd) D A Mehta (former judge of Gujarat High Court), the ISL Commission has Justice B N Mehta (former judge, Gujarat High Court), D Sivanandhan (former Director General of Police, Maharashtra), Vidushpat Singhania (legal professional and sports law expert) and Kiran More (former Indian cricketer).
The Regulatory Commission, having heard the parties at length ruled out FC Goa's claims on 'Double Jeopardy' and ISL Regulatory Commissions' lack of 'Jurisdiction'.
All the parties have the option to exercise their right to appeal under the ISL League rules to the ISL Appeals Panel comprising Justice (Retd) Kshitij R Vyas, former Chief Justice of Bombay High Court.
On December 20 last, after Chennaiyin FC defeated FC Goa 3-2 in the ISL final in Margao, a scuffle broke out.
Chennaiyin FC's marquee player Elano was accused by FC Goa co-owner Dattaraj Salgaocar of physically assaulting him in an altercation that occurred at the home team's dugout after the final whistle.
Dattaraj filed an FIR in a local police station.
Elano was arrested and subsequently released but only after spending a night in police custody.
The ISL regulatory commission then issued notices to the parties involved and also asked FC Goa why action should not be taken for boycotting the post-match prize distribution.
Meanwhile, video footages also emerged which purportedly showed that Elano did not resort to any aggressive conduct during that scuffle.
In the footages, FC Goa officials were seen pushing and shoving Elano with one of them apparently laying his hand on the face of the Brazilian World Cupper who tried to free himself from the scuffle.
FC Goa, who have already been punished by the All India Football Federation's disciplinary committee with a fine of Rs 50 lakh, have maintained that issuance of notices by both AIFF and ISL Regulatory Commission for the same alleged breaches violates their fundamental rights and amounts to double jeopardy.
