Sevilla won the Europa League in 2014 and 2015 How to follow: Text commentary on the BBC Sport website Sevilla coach Unai Emery believes it will be a big ask for the Europa League champions to reach the final despite their slender advantage over Shakhtar Donetsk.
Kevin Gameiro's late penalty earned Sevilla a 2-2 draw in Ukraine in last week's semi-final first leg and the two sides meet again on Thursday.
Those away goals mean a goalless draw will be enough for Sevilla to progress.
"We're expecting the best Shakhtar there is," said Emery.
"They won the tournament in 2009 and they're used to winning their league.
"It is a big ask - they'll be 90 tough minutes and we need to be ready for it."
Sevilla will be without midfielder Michael Krohn-Dehli after he was taken off on a stretcher in the first leg with a serious knee injury.
For Shakhtar, Marcio Azevedo is out because of a knee problem, while Dentinho and Oleksandr Hladkyy are doubtful.
The Europa League represents Sevilla's only chance of playing in next season's Champions League after a run of just one win in seven La Liga games ended their league hopes.
Shakhtar, meanwhile, are in good form.
They are unbeaten in their previous 10 games, winning seven of them.
The winner of Thursday's semi-final second leg will meet either Liverpool or Villarreal in the final at Basel's St Jakob-Park stadium on 18 May.
