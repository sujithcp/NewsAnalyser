Despite an impeccable record with the willow in Test matches, Amla failed to find any takers during any of the IPL auctions.
Amla's inclusion in the Kings XI Punjab squad comes only as a replacement for injured Australian Shaun Marsh , who has been ruled out with a back injury for the rest of this season's IPL.
The 33-year-old Amla, who has an average of 31.35 in 88 matches at a strike rate of 125.95, including 16 half centuries, took to social networking website Twitter to express his delight after the announcement.
"Excited to be with @lionsdenkxip for the remainder of the @ipl.
Looking forward to it.
Thanks for the support peeps," Amla tweeted.
The Kings XI are languishing at the bottom of the IPL standings having only won two of their first seven games.
