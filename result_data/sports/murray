Andy Murray will lose his world number two ranking to Roger Federer unless he successfully defends his title in MadridDefending champion Andy Murray reached the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open with an impressive 6-4 6-2 win over 16th seed Gilles Simon of France.
Second seed Murray, 28, broke Simon for the first time to take the opening set as part of a five-game winning run.
He then broke three times in the second set to complete victory in one hour, 38 minutes.
Britain's Murray will play either Czech Tomas Berdych or Spaniard David Ferrer in the last eight.
Murray's serve was never broken and the power and variety of his ground strokes was too much for Simon, 31.
World number one Novak Djokovic, who won in Madrid in 2011, plays Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut later on Thursday.
Four-time winner Rafael Nadal, who lost to Murray is last year's final, plays Sam Querrey of the United States in the evening session.
