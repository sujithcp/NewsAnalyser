David Willey joined Yorkshire from Northants in August 2015Yorkshire all-rounder David Willey has been told not to bowl for six weeks because of an abdominal injury.
However, the 26-year-old could still bat in the White Rose county's current Championship game against Surrey if required to do so.
The injury means Willey could be unavailable for some of England's one-day international series against Sri Lanka next month.
He has played 13 one-dayers and 11 Twenty20 matches for the national team.
Willey took two wickets in his first match for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire last week and 3-55 on the opening day against Surrey.
