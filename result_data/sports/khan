Amir Khan (right) last fought at the MGM Grand in December 2014, beating American Devon AlexanderAmir Khan says he is unlikely to fight Floyd Mayweather if the American makes his expected return from retirement.
"He messed me around, so I'd probably treat him the same way - I don't think I'd take that fight," said Khan.
Amir Khan insists Saul Alvarez is 'beatable'"Floyd's probably missing not having his picture on the MGM," added Khan.
"He must see my picture and Canelo's picture and think 'people have forgotten about me'.
As soon as you say you're retired, we do forget about the people who say that.
"Mayweather's feeling that now, he's feeling like no-one's talking about him, that he's old news, and maybe that's why he's trying to get everyone supporting him again by saying 'I want to make a comeback'.
"Whatever Mayweather says, let him say it."
Saul Alvarez's only career defeat came against Floyd MayweatherKhan's bout with 25-year-old Alvarez is the biggest of his 11-year professional career.
Khan, a two-time former world champion, has won 31 and lost three of his 34 professional fights but has not held a world title since 2012.
Tottenham's draw at Chelsea on Monday sealed the Premier League title for Leicester"It is unbelievable how a team like Leicester have come up from nowhere and took the title," added Khan.
"This is similar to what I am going in to with this fight against Canelo, because I am the underdog.
"I think it is the year of the underdog with Leicester and me going in to this fight.
It is our year."
