Derbyshire opener Chesney Hughes hit his second unbeaten County Championship century of the summer as their game with Northants ended in a tame draw.
Hughes, who made 96 and 137 not out in the first game of the season, struck 109 not out and shared an opening stand of 215 with Billy Godleman (94).
Earlier Northants were all out for 470 - a first-innings' lead of 146 - with Richard Levi last man to go for 104.
But Derbyshire eased past the deficit as they declared on 229-1.
On an otherwise untroubled day for the batsmen, there was one moment of controversy before tea when Godleman appeared to be caught at deep point by Jake Libby but declined to walk.
He was eventually given not out after a long conversation between umpires Martin Saggers and Russell Evans sparking a protest from Northants captain Alex Wakely.
Libby managed to remove Godleman in bizarre circumstances six short of his century when he hit his own wicket while trying to cut the ball, but the incident left a sour taste on an otherwise uninspiring final day.
