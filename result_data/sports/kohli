Virat Kohli is often compared with India’s maestro Sachin Tendulkar.
(Source: PTI)Veteran left-hander Yuvraj Singh feels India Test captain Virat Kohli is the best batsman of this generation but deemed it unfair to compare him with Sachin Tendulkar as he feels that it will take a lot more hardwork from the Delhi lad to match the maestro’s legacy.
Yuvraj said Kohli and South African AB de Villiers are presently the best batsmen of the generation and hoped the former too becomes a great player for India just like Tendulkar.
“I think 100 centuries is really far away to think,” Yuvraj said when asked if Kohli would be able to reach Tendulkar’s milestone of 100 international tons.
“Tendulkar was a great player and great ambassador of India and it is going to take a lot (of hardwork) for Virat Kohli to come in comparision with that,” he told NDTV.
“Virat (Kohli) is in great form.
He is the best batsman of this generation wlong with AB de Villiers.
So, I hope one day he becomes a great player for India.”
Yuvraj, who is yet to feature in the ongoing Indian Premier League for his new franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad because of an ankle injury, said he is fit to take the field on Friday against Gujarat Lions at Hyderabad.
“I am hoping to play tomorrow’s game in Hyderabad,” he said.
“As long as I am playing I want to play all three formats whenever I get an opportunity to play.”
