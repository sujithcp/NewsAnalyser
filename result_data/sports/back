Virat Kohli admitted that he had discussed the prospect of coaching India “a while back” with Daniel Vettori, but downplayed the matter, stating that a number of candidates had been spoken to.
“All these things do come up when there is a scenario where you have to appoint someone (as a coach),” he said here on Thursday.
Spoke a while back “I don’t know how it has come out now.
I had spoken to him a while back.
“We had spoken to a few other people as well, which everyone knows about.
“I can’t say anything more about it because I don’t know how it has come out now.”
Ravi Shastri’s contract as team director ended with the World T20, since when a number of names have been linked with the Indian coaching job.
Vettori is currently coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, where Kohli is captain.
When asked if any Indian names were being discussed, Kohli retorted: “You guys (the media) tend to know more about it, so I will wait for your verdict on that.
“I certainly don’t know what’s going on.
I’m not giving you any masala.”
