The eight selected spin bowlers are Bjorn Fortuin, Simon Harmer, George Linde, Keshav Maharaj, Tshepo Ntuli, Aaron Phangiso, Dane Piedt, and Prenelan Subrayen.
The batsmen going on the course are Temba Bavuma, Reeza Hendricks, Smangaliso Nhlebela, Hector Ngobeni, Stiaan van Zyl, and Dane Vilas.
The group will be accompanied by CSA batting consultant HD Ackerman, and CSA spin bowling consultant Claude Henderson.
"Simon Harmer, Dane Piedt, Prenalen Subrayen and Keshav Maharaj who have been on previous spin camps, have seen the benefits of working with top Indian spin coaches," Barnes said.
"It has also become quite an important initiative to improve our batsmenÂ’s techniques and game plans against spin.
Temba Bavuma, Rilee Rossouw and Stiaan van Zyl are some of the batsmen who have credited their improvement of batting against spin to the spin camps (in the subcontinent)," Barnes added.
