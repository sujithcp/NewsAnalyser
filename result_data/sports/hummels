A fan holds up a banner asking Mats Hummels 'why?'
at Borussia Dortmund's game against WolfsburgMats Hummels has accused Borussia Dortmund of issuing a "dirty statement" after his club recently said he wanted to leave them for rivals Bayern Munich.
The 27-year-old Germany defender was booed and whistled by sections of the crowd during a 5-1 home win over Wolfsburg on Saturday.
Hummels started his career at Bayern before joining Dortmund in 2009.
"Nothing has been decided yet," Hummels told supporters waiting outside the club's training ground on Wednesday.
"This dirty statement created a different impression."
Should Hummels join Bayern he will become the third player to make such a move in the past three years after midfielder Mario Gotze in 2013 and striker Robert Lewandowski in 2014.
