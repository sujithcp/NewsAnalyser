Chennai Customs beat Southern Railway 3-1 to move ahead of MSU in the CFA senior division league at the Nehru stadium on Wednesday.
Southern Railway, with 16 points and two games to go, is tied with Chennai FC in the third spot.
Railway created more and converted none in the first half.
Sirajudeen took a long shot at goal from a few feet inside the top-half, on the right, which the goalkeeper misread.
However, the ball went past the left post.
P.C.
Riju got close to his threat of a cross from a corner-kick later, taken at the left, but missed.
Sirajudeen was to miss in turn, fed off a pass from Riju, with only the goalkeeper to beat.
Riju’s corner kick then was headed above the post by M. Elamurugan.
Customs scored off one of its two potent chances; J. Poovarasan scored off D. Jeba Kumar’s cross from extreme left in the 21st minute.
It led 1-0 at the break.
Railway’s equaliser came off a free-kick at the start of the second half; R. Rajesh’s free-kick from inside-left was tapped in by Elamurugan.
Another strike from Jeba Kumar and one from B. Sri Ram put Customs ahead for the rest of the match.
The contest didn’t taper smooth; Railway’s Rajesh and Customs’s Sri Ram were shown red cards for serious foul-play, a rough tackle between the two, and fierce arguments after.
The results: Senior div.
: Chennai Customs 3 (Jeba Kumar 21, 71, Sriram 74) bt Southern Railway 1 (Elamurugan 51).
I div.
