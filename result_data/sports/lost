Aravindh Chithambaram lived up to his reputation and seeding by scoring an important final-round victory to emerge as the Asian junior chess champion as India won five out of the six medals on offer here on Wednesday.
Overnight leader S.L.
Narayanan was held by Iran’s Seyed Khalil Mousavi while M. Karthikeyan could only draw against Rajdeep Sarkar.

The tie-break rules favoured Aravindh owing to his sixth-round victory over Narayanan.
In the girls’ section, Mongolia’s Uuriintuya Uurtsaikh punished an erratic R. Vaishali, the top seed, in 36 moves to take the gold medal.
