Rajat Bhatia has played most of his cricket in Delhi.
After being unceremoniously eased out of Delhi’s Ranji Trophy team last season, the seasoned campaigner has clearly not come to terms with the shabby treatment.
Without provocation, the Rising Pune Supergiants all-rounder came up with a line that left most of the scribes surprised during the media interaction on the eve of the tie against Delhi Daredevils.
“The Delhi pitch and association keep changing.
So you can’t say, anything might happen here,” said Bhatia, once with Rajasthan Royals.
“We have nothing to lose.
We have also got two new entrants in Usman Khawaja and George Bailey.
I hope we get the right combination and start winning matches,” he added.
Striking an optimistic note despite the team’s six defeats in eight games, Bhatia said, “Some teams that are doing well might lose momentum towards the end.
You can’t judge any team right now.
It’s T20 cricket.”
Almost dismissive of Zaheer Khan’s captaincy, Bhatia said, “Well, he has just become captain this year, and how many matches have they (Daredevils) played – seven?
I know Zaheer, I’ve played with him and know him personally.
“He’s doing well, and I wish him luck.
But not against us!”
