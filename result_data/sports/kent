Kent captain Sam Northeast reached his highest first-class score of 189 to help gain a useful first-innings lead on a weather-hit day at Canterbury.
After a lost morning session, Kent went from 304-3 after lunch to 397-6 at tea, just missing maximum batting points.
Northeast added 35 to his overnight 154 before being bowled by Josh Shaw, but Darren Stevens (54) kept the tail ticking over as Kent built their lead.
Matt Hunn then hit the last three balls for six as Kent closed on 478-9.
Having resumed following another rain break at 18:20 BST, in the space of six overs Hunn (32 not out) and Calum Haggett (33 not out) put on an unbroken 54 to set up an expected overnight declaration.
Northeast finished just 11 short of a maiden double century, but he did go past two personal records.
First he surpassed both his previous Championship-best score of 165, made against Derbyshire in September 2012, and his best first-class score of 176, made against Loughborough MCCU in May 2011.
Kent pace bowler Matt Hunn told BBC Radio Kent:
"There was talk of declaring if the lead was big enough, but the way they bowled didn't allow us to get the lead we wanted.
"The word from the coaching staff for the last six overs was just be around and to score runs as they come.
Last over I thought I'd back myself with the slog sweep and luckily it came off.
"It will be tough work out there tomorrow, but we've got our game plans and if we can put them into practice we'll be there."
