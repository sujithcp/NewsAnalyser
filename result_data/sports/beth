Beth Tweddle was honoured at a ceremony at Liverpool Cathedral
Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle has been given an Honorary Fellowship from the university where she studied, Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU).
The 27-year-old was honoured for her outstanding contribution to sport at a graduation ceremony at Liverpool Cathedral on Monday.
The gymnast graduated from LJMU in 2007 with a BSc (Hons) in Sport and Exercise Sciences.
She has competed in three Olympics and won bronze at London 2012.
Tweddle, who won the medal in the uneven bars, was aged only seven when she started gymnastics.
Within 18 months, she was ranked second in the country and went on to win World Championship titles in the asymmetric bars in 2006 and the floor in 2009.
That year she set up the company, Total Gymnastics, with Olympian swimmer Steve Parry, to help children with talent receive the support they need for their future sporting careers.
Tweddle was made an MBE in the 2010 New Year's Honours List.
LJMU Vice-Chancellor Nigel Weatherill said: "Beth is one of our most exceptional graduates and we are delighted to recognise her achievements through the conferment of an Honorary Fellowship.
"Beth continues to inspire both our students and staff and future generations of competitors through her work with schools and gymnastic clubs.
"There is no doubt that she is one of the all time greats in her sport."
