James Davis, Laurence Halsted and Richard Kruse will again make up Great Britain's fencing squad for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
The trio will all compete in the individual and men's team foil events.
The three also competed in the 2012 London Games, where GB finished sixth in the team event, and Kruse, 32, will be going to his fourth Games.
Kruse said: "It's the pinnacle of the sport so to be able to go out for my fourth Games is going to be brilliant."
Alex Newton, Team GB Fencing team leader, said: "The experience they all have is really important.
It's a huge opportunity now.
"They are there by right and given the field and where they are within that, there is a real medal chance."
Fencing has been incorporated in every Games since 1896, in which Great Britain have won nine medals.
