West Indies opener Chris Gayle and out-of-favour Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad were involved in a friendly banter on Twitter.
West Indies superstar Chris Gayle took a friendly jibe at Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad, who has been dropped from the list of probables for England tour.
Shehzad took to Twitter to initiate a chat-session with his fans.
In response to the tweet, Gayle, who had been teammates with the Pakistan opener at Jamaica Tallawahs during the inaugural edition of the Caribbean Premier League, asked Shehzad whether excessive selfies were the reason behind his axing from the Pakistan team.
Shehzad is known for posing for selfies and his Twitter wall makes it evident.
Gayle, who had shared the dressing room with him, was quick to use it against him.
Shehzad, who has played 11 Tests, 75 ODIs and 44 T20Is, was reportedly dropped due to issues with his attitude and discipline.
Pakistan chief-selector Inzamam-ul-Haq said he had spoken to all the selectors and other stakeholders of Pakistan cricket and also gone through the reports of the former coach and manager before taking the decision to drop Shehzad and Umar Akmal from the side.Gayle, who recently became father and named his daughter 'Blush', has been in poor form for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the ongoing ninth edition of the Indian Premier League.
The explosive left-handed opener has so far played only three out of RCB's seven matches and aggregates a mere eight runs.
