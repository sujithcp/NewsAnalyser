Karachi, May 12: Ahmed Shehzad 's attempt to get into the national training camp for the England tour proved unsuccessful after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) informed him he would not be considered in present circumstances.
The Pakistani opening batsman, who was not included in a list of 35 probables for the boot camp which begins in Abbotabad from tomorrow, wrote to the board chairman Shaharyar Khan on the issue.

Referring to the new selection committee's decision to drop him on disciplinary grounds, Shehzad wrote to the PCB that he would reform his behaviour and be more disciplined in future if he was given a chance to attend the camp.
But a source in the board told PTI that chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq had taken a strong stance on the matter despite some senior officials in the board being sympathetic to Shehzad.
"Inzamam told the board that if Shehzad was allowed to attend the camp it would set a bad precedent for the future and send a wrong message to the other players," the source said.
"Inzamam has said he would discuss the selection of Shehzad with new head coach Mickey Arthur when he reaches Pakistan and see what course of action should be taken on the opener for the England tour," the source added.
Another source didn't rule out the possibility of Shehzad being a late inclusion in the camp.
"But for the moment he has been sent a reply by the board that they can't allow him to attend the camp and he needs to work on his behaviour and cricket discipline."
Inzamam also dropped batsman Umar Akmal for the camp, but he has not made any plea to the board and leaves today today to play for Leicestershire in England and than in the Caribbean League.
Shehzad told reporters in Peshawar that he was keen to play for Pakistan.
"I am ready for all sacrifices and I am willing to do anything to get a chance to play for my country," he said.
