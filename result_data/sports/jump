The second leg of the Indian Grand Prix athletics, to be held at the National Institute of Sports here on Friday, will be the third Rio Olympics qualification event in 10 days but not too many big names are expected to turn up with injuries and fatigue being equally responsible.
The only decent field is likely to be in the 100m sprints with all three medallists from both the first leg of the event and the Federation Cup in Delhi competing.
Dutee Chand, who missed the Olympic mark by one-hundredth of a second, Srabani Nanda and H.M. Jothi will all be in action though they agree that coming so close again so soon may not be possible.
“It takes time for the body to recover but there has been none.
Medals don’t matter now, timing does and we will try our best to push ahead.
But it won’t be easy.
If it happens, great, but we are confident of doing it later also,” both Srabani and Dutee concur.
Also, the NIS is in the process of laying a new track and the event, therefore, will be held on what is normally used for training.
“This is not ideal for competition so qualification marks or even new records are highly unlikely,” athletes and officials admit.
Among the prominent absentees would be Lalita Babar and Sudha Singh, both having already qualified in the 3000m steeplechase and concentrating on improving their performances at the upcoming Shanghai Diamond League, to be held on May 14, instead.
Their entries were sent by the AFI after the Fed Cup.
Injuries have also ruled out O.P.
Jaisha in the 1500m and Mayookha Johnny in the triple jump.
Jumpers Ankit Sharma and Premkumar Kumaravel, back from their training stint in South Africa, will be hoping to qualify for Rio.
The qualifying standard is 8.15m and both have jumps over 8m against their names even though they haven’t crossed the mark for a while now.
In the field events, Krishna Punia will be in action in what is likely to be her last meet at home this season before travelling to the USA for training and competitions till the end of June.
Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, also suffering from a muscle strain, is unlikely to participate though shot-putter Tejinder Pal Singh, who surprised everyone by winning gold in Delhi with an impressive throw of 19.93m, is confident of bettering his mark.
