Hoyland has scored eight tries in 22 outings for Edinburgh this seasonEdinburgh wing Damien Hoyland will warm up for Scotland's summer tour of Japan by playing for Scotland's Sevens side in Paris this weekend.
The 22-year-old, named on Monday in Vern Cotter's squad for the two-Test trip next month, has finished his domestic season with the capital side.
Hoyland won his sole senior cap as a replacement in a pre-World Cup warm-up test in Italy last August.
It will be his first appearance since the final round of last year's series at Twickenham, when his five tries were the springboard for a senior XVs call-up.
"Damien will add potency to our attack," said Scotland sevens coach Calum MacRae, whose 12-man squad also includes departing Edinburgh wing Dougie Fife and Glasgow's Edinburgh-bound full-back Glenn Bryce.
"He is excited about playing on the World Series again and is high on confidence having just been selected for the national team's tour to Japan."
The final round of this year's series takes place in London on 21-22 May.
