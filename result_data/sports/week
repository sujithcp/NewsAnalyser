BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.
Lawro's opponents for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is two-time world darts champion Adrian 'Jackpot' Lewis.
Lewis, who won the PDC title in 2011 and 2012, will be taking part in the new Champions League of Darts competition, which will be shown on BBC Sport in September.
He is a Stoke City fan, and went to his first game at the age of six at the Potters' former home, the Victoria Ground.
"All the banter in the practice room revolves around football," says Lewis.
"Phil 'The Power' Taylor is a Port Vale fan so I always rip into him.
""My granddad took me and he told me we were going conker picking," Lewis said.
"I just remember walking there and seeing everyone wearing the same shirt.
"My favourite Stoke player when I was growing up was Paul Peschisolido - I named my goldfish 'Peschi' after him.
Now we've got the likes of Bojan Krkic and Xherdan Shaquiri, which shows how far we have come as a club.
"If you asked me about how this season has gone for us a month ago, I would have said 'brilliant' but the last four games have not gone to plan.
Hopefully we can do a bit better this week."
You can hear more of Lewis' tales of following the Potters on Football Focus at 12:10 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.

Norwich are fighting the drop, while Manchester United are hoping to catch Manchester City in fourth place.
I think whether they make the top four or not will decide Louis van Gaal's future as United manager - winning the FA Cup final will not make any difference.
Getting some silverware will be great but being in the Champions League means far more for everything, from sponsorship to attracting players.
Norwich have now lost three games in a row, without scoring in any of them, and it is that lack of goals which looks like it will cost them.
The Canaries have tailed off at the worst possible time.
Are they going to turn this bad run around?
Probably not.
I find it very strange that Aston Villa have not appointed a new manager yet.
Newcastle will have a massive support at Villa Park, despite Villa turning down their request for a bigger ticket allocation.
I think their battle for survival will go right to the final day, and the fact Newcastle are playing Tottenham at home will definitely help them if Spurs have got second place sewn up by then.
The relegation battle - remaining gamesNewcastleSunderlandNorwichAston Villa (a)Chelsea (h)Man Utd (h)Tottenham (h)Everton (h)Everton (a)Watford (a)
Lewis' prediction: Newcastle still have a fighting chance of staying up.
0-1
Like the Baggies, Bournemouth are safe but are on a poor run of form - they have lost their last three matches - and both sides will probably be happy not to be beaten.
Crystal Palace's players will undoubtedly have the FA Cup final at the back of their minds - no matter what their manager says about people playing for their places, it is hard to get players to run the extra mile in a league game with Wembley only a couple of weeks away.
The Eagles are not mathematically safe yet, and I don't see them getting a win this week, but I also don't see them going down.
Lewis' prediction: I am hoping Stoke can get the job done here.
1-2
Jermain Defoe reveals secret to Sunderland's spiritSunderland are still hard to beat, but still not winning - with last week's draw against Stoke the latest case in point.
That obviously needs to change, especially with relegation rivals Newcastle, who are a point above them, playing Villa this weekend.
The Black Cats have a game in hand, which is at home to Everton next Wednesday, and I think it will be easier for them to beat the Toffees than it will be against Chelsea.
The important thing for Sunderland is not to lose on Saturday, because four points from their next two games would put them level on points with Newcastle - and probably put Sam Allardyce's side above them on goal difference with one game to play.
Lewis' prediction: Chelsea will want to finish the season on a high.
0-2
Swansea are a funny team - they were well beaten by a Newcastle side that was struggling to win an argument at the time, then rolled over and shipped four goals against Leicester but, a week later, they played really well to beat Liverpool.
The Swans basically went from abysmal to excellent in the space of a week, and they will need to be at their best against West Ham.
I have been really impressed by the Hammers of late and they are back in the race for fourth place, especially because they play Manchester United in their last game at the Boleyn Ground on Tuesday.
The Leicester players will have been on another planet this week after winning the title, and quite rightly so.
And while they might be saying they want to win their last home game, I know from personal experience with Liverpool in the 1980s that it is not the same now the job is done - and now they have been on the booze.
The best bits from Claudio Ranieri's post-title news conferenceThe Leicester players have put in this monumental effort and now it is a bit like letting some air out of your tyres.
Everton don't need the points so there is no pressure on them either - it will be a day of celebration and if Leicester lose, so what?
Lewis' prediction: Leicester will still be on a high and I can see Everton nicking it.
0-1
There will be an air of disappointment around White Hart Lane now their title hopes have gone.
If they were nowhere near the title then finishing second would be seen as a great achievement - which it is - but coming close means it hurts, and Spurs will be low.
So this will be a case of 'after the Lord Mayor's Show' but it will still mean a lot to Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino to round off such an excellent season with a good performance against his former club in their final home game.
'Leicester are 'deserved champions' Lewis's prediction: With Tottenham's disappointment at missing out on the title I can see a draw.
1-1
With Watford, I just hope somebody sees sense and sits down with the manager Quique Sanchez Flores and says 'what do we need to improve again next season?'
If the rumours are true about him leaving at the end of the season, then I really do not get the logic behind that decision.
Everyone knows he is a really good manager, so why cast him aside?
Lewis' prediction: This will be comfortable for Liverpool.
3-0
Manchester City have won the Capital One Cup and reached the Champions League semi-finals, but it has still been a disappointing season for them.
It is exactly the same for Arsenal, who have been out of the title race for weeks now.
Real Madrid 1-0 Manchester City: BBC Football Daily video match reportA point would pretty much make sure of third place for the Gunners but I just do not fancy them away from home at the moment.
I think too many of their players are on their holidays.
City will move above Arsenal on goal difference if they win, but are in danger of dropping out of the top four if they lose.
I am going for the former - it is Manuel Pellegrini's final home game in charge of City and the players and fans will want to give him a decent send-off at Eithad Stadium.
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
