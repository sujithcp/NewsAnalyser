Doncaster face one more fixture against Arsenal before the league break at the end of MayDoncaster Rovers Belles manager Glen Harris says the club need to make signings when the transfer window opens on 3 June.
Belles have lost all three of their opening Women's Super League One fixtures this season, after winning promotion last year.
"We know we need to strengthen because we're a very thin squad," said Harris.
"We're a couple of player's short and we need to put pressure on the players that we already have."
He added: "Those players in my view have not quite come to the standard that they've shown in training."
But Harris insists that the club are confident that they can "regroup" during the month-long break at the end of May.
"If you look at the run of games we've had, we've not had the easiest of starts," he told BBC Sport.
"The morale is good but when you've lost three games on the trot, it does knock your confidence a bit.
"I don't think it's a lack of belief though, I think it's just that little bit of confidence, that little rub of the green to get you going."
