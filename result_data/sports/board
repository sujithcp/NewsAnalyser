With India scheduled to tour Zimbabwe just a month from now the Board of Control for Cricket in India is yet to identify candidates for the posts of the team’s coach and the support staff.
Ravi Shastri had performed the role as Team Director with Sanjay Bangar, B. Arun and R. Sridhar as his assistants for more than a year.
The team did reasonably well during Shastri’s tenure and earned praise for the overall progress under the captaincy of M.S.
Dhoni (ODIs and T20s) and Virat Kohli (Tests).
Their contracts, however, ended with the ICC World Twenty20 in March-April where India made it to the semifinals before losing to the West Indies.
In the recent past various names have cropped up for the coach’s post, ranging from Stephen Fleming to Rahul Dravid.
The latest to join the list is Daniel Vettori, who has been involved with Royal Challengers Bangalore as head coach.
Not met Interestingly, the three-member advisory committee of the Board, comprising Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.
Laxman and Sourav Ganguly, has reportedly not met even once to discuss the issue.
The Board obviously has not had time to discuss this matter due to the ongoing deliberations in the Supreme Court on the Lodha Committee recommendations.
The Board has taken a significant decision of appointing a chief executive officer which awaits the approval of the Working Committee.
According to sources, Shastri has indicated his willingness to continue in the post with a proper contract in place.
His rapport with Virat Kohli, who is expected to lead India in all three formats, is said to be the reason for him being possibly retained in the post — Team Director or coach?
The pressing issue before the Board is to find time to finalise the support staff selections for the season.
