And Yuvraj, who was playing for the Sunrisers Hyderabad against Mumbai Indians at the latter's new home ground in Visakhapatnam, went a step ahead to show his mark of respect by bending down and touching his idol's feet after the match.
Yuvraj though was stopped by Tendulkar before being embraced near the boundary line.
Tendulkar, the mentor of the defending champions, was present in the dugout.
Just when Tendulkar was on air, talking about how bat was dominating ball in modern-day cricket, SRH bowlers came up with a strong show and shot down Mumbai for 92 and sealed a 85-run win for their team.
Yuvraj showed glimpses of his vintage self with a 23-ball 39.
Yuvraj had similarly touched Tendulkar's feet during the Lord's Bicentenary celebration match in July 2014.
Yuvraj hit a 132-ball 134 for Rest of the World against the Tendulkar-led Marylebone Cricket Club.
