Sachin Tendulkar has offered to share his experiences with Rio-bound athletes ahead of the Olympics.
Reacting to the Indian Olympic Association’s invitation to be a Goodwill Ambassador of the Indian contingent, Tendulkar has sought IOA’s plans about his involvement.
“It will be my pleasure to meet these world-class athletes before they leave for Rio to learn about their experiences and preparations.
“I am also happy to be part of any awareness campaign that can rally the country around our athletes, including amplifying their efforts and success on my Twitter and Facebook accounts,” Tendulkar wrote to IOA on Tuesday.
The letter, addressed to IOA president N. Ramachandran and secretary Rajeev Mehta, has been written in response to IOA’s letter on April 28, requesting him to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Olympics.
Meanwhile, Mr. Mehta said: “Sachin Tendulkar has accepted our request to become Goodwill Ambassador of the Indian contingent at the Olympics.
We have received the official communication from him accepting our request.”
