Bangladesh lifted a ban on disgraced fast bowler Shahadat Hossain on Tuesday, allowing him to play domestic matches weeks after he apologised for torturing an 11-year-old girl he employed as maid.
Hossain was banned from all forms of cricket last year by the BCB after he became a subject of investigation for alleged criminal offence, which drew huge media interest.
BCB said Hossain was now free to play domestic cricket, including the Bangladesh Premier League, after he made an emotional appeal seeking a return to cricket.
“He, however, will not be considered for national team selection until his legal issues are settled,” BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury said, adding the ban was lifted on “humanitarian considerations”.
