Steven Davis added to Tottenham’s misery in the aftermath of its failed Premier League title challenge as the Southampton midfielder’s double sealed a 2-1 win on Sunday.
Mauricio Pochettino’s side had gifted the crown to Leicester after squandering the lead in successive draws against West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea and its gloom deepened after another self-inflicted setback at White Hart Lane.
Having taken an early lead through South Korea midfielder Son Heung-Min, Tottenham was on course to effectively guarantee a second-place finish.
But a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris allowed Davis to equalise before half-time and the Northern Ireland international struck again after the break to leave the north Londoners without a win in their last three matches.
Sixth-placed Southampton remains in the hunt for a Europa League place and will surpass its best points total in the division with a draw in its final fixture against Crystal Palace.
After the acrimonious scenes at Stamford Bridge on Monday, where Tottenham’s players reacted with ugly aggression to their costly draw against Chelsea, the sight of Leicester hoisting the Premier League trophy amid champagne fuelled celebrations on Saturday rubbed further salt into their wounds.
And Tottenham’s regret at failing to win the title for the first time since 1961 was compounded by another meltdown in the north London sunshine.
The results: Tottenham 1 (Son 16) lost to Southampton 2 (Davis 31 & 72).
Saturday: Leicester 3 (Vardy 5, 65-pen, King 33) bt Everton 1 (Mirallas 88).
