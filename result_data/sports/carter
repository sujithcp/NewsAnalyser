Dan Carter joined Racing 92 after retiring from international rugby having won the 2015 World CupEuropean Rugby Champions Cup: Racing 92 v Saracens Venue: Grand Stade de Lyon Date: Saturday, 14 May Kick-off: 16:45 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, plus text commentary on the BBC Sport website
Saracens would be making a big error by targeting Dan Carter during Saturday's European Champions Cup final, says director of rugby Mark McCall.
New Zealand World Cup-winning fly-half Carter, 34, has helped Parisians Racing 92 to their first European final.
Carter is the reigning World Rugby player of the year and the leading points scorer in Test history.
"It's a big, big, big mistake to think you're going to go and get Dan Carter," said McCall.
"Dan Carter's been doing this for a very long time.
So we've got to make sure that his influence in the game isn't huge, isn't unbelievably significant.
"And if we can do that it means our pack have got on top in the scrum, in the line-out.
It means we'll have put a little bit more pressure on him than he's experienced before.
"But if you run down his channel and think you're going to shake him up, you're not going to."
Saracens' England fly-half Owen Farrell is keen to emulate Carter's unflustered approach.
"Trying to be calmer on the pitch, it's definitely something I'm always trying to do."
