While Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and A.B.
de Villiers form the core of the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) batting line-up, there is plenty of room for others to make a contribution as well.
Karnataka lad K.L.
Rahul is a good example, notching up three fifties in the five innings he has played so far.
Sachin Baby’s numbers may not place him in the same league as Rahul but the Kerala cricketer has done his best to establish a spot in the eleven.
In two matches, Baby has made a 16-ball 27 (at three-drop, against Sunrisers Hyderabad) and an eight-ball 16 (at four-drop, against Kolkata Knight Riders), though RCB went on to lose both ties.
“I always believed in my game.
My coach and captain have backed me right from the beginning.
The coach (Daniel Vettori) had asked me to make best use of the opportunities that I get,” the southpaw said here on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old was understandably hesitant to comment on RCB’s bowling woes this season, but stated that the arrival of England pace bowler Chris Jordan will strengthen the attack.
“We have batted really well, but the bowling has failed.
But now, we have Chris Jordan in the team.
We have been lacking a quality bowler, so Chris’ arrival will strengthen our line-up, and hopefully we will start winning.
“Our bowlers had a meeting after the previous match.
I think they have come up with better ideas to tackle the situation.
We can be like Mumbai Indians, who were at the bottom of the table midway through last season, but fought back to win the title.”
