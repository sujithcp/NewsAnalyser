A title on the professional circuit continued to be elusive for Sidharth Rawat as he was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Shintaro Imai of Japan in the final of the $10,000 ITF menâ€™s Futures tennis tournament at the Harvest Academy, Jassowal, on Saturday.
It was the third loss in a final for the 23-year-old Sidharth, who had lost the earlier finals to compatriots Vijay Sundar Prashanth and Sasi Kumar Mukund.
Sidharth dropped serve in the third game and lost the first set.
He slipped to 1-4 in the second, before making a brief fight of it.
He missed three breakpoints to make it 4-4, and the Japanese recovered and raced to victory, in an hour and 54 minutes.
Imai had earlier beaten Mohit Mayur and Sriram Balaji among the Indians.
Sidharth had won three matches on the trot in three sets, but his effort to make a fight of it in the final proved inadequate.
All said, a final entry was a good sign for the Delhi lad, a National championship finalist, who had recently played the final of the Asian Tennis Tour (ATT) event against Vishnu Vardhan.
Shintaro Imai (Jpn) bt Sidharth Rawat 6-4, 6-4.
