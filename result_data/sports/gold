Tim StockdaleShowjumper Tim Stockdale has set his sights on competing at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games at the age of 52.
The Northamptonshire rider just missed out on selection for London 2012 after recovering from a broken neck.
Stockdale told BBC Northampton the disappointment had fired his desire to be part of the British team in Brazil.
"I'll be 52, younger than 50% of the team which won a gold medal at this year's Games, so it's a realistic aim," he insisted.
Great Britain capture their first Olympic showjumping gold medal in 60 yearsStockdale, who competed for Great Britain at the 2008 Games in Beijing, was a spectator as the team of Peter Charles, Scott Brash, Nick Skelton and Ben Maher won the gold medal in Greenwich Park in August.
It was Britain's first show jumping team gold for 60 years.
"I'm not going to lie and say it was just totally brilliant, it wasn't," said Stockdale.
"It was a strange moment, because it was one of those moments when I really wished it was me - but I was pleased for the lads, they did a great job, and that's how sport is, there's a very fine line between success and failure.
"I'm very lucky to be walking and still fighting, and if anything it has ignited the flames.
"I've invested in a new horse for Rio, and a really good one.
He could be one of the best horses I've ever had and that's really exciting."
