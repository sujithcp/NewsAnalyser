Virat Kohli’s passion for football is well-known in India.
On Thursday, appearing as brand ambassador for Premier Futsal, he offered Falcao, one of the world’s most popular futsal players and one of the tournament’s ‘marquee’ signings, a glimpse of his love for the sport.
“I told Falcao that I always carry a pair of football shoes in my bag.
I prefer to do even my fielding drills in them,” said Kohli, who can often be seen doing fielding practice with football boots on, perhaps to reduce risk of injury.
India’s Test captain added: “Whenever the team’s feeling a bit down or you’ve had a hectic travel day and you’re just not able to get that energy in your normal warm-ups, football gives you that extra motivation to run after a ball.
It gets the competitive nature out in a big way.”
The Brazilian, for his part, hailed Kohli as a fenomeno in cricket.
