Lucasz Fabianski denies West Ham's Diafra Sakho in Swansea's 4-1 at Upton ParkGoalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski says Swansea City have improved since Francesco Guidolin arrived at the club in January.
Guidolin was appointed head coach until the end of the season and has led Swansea to Premier League safety.
The Italian's future is unclear, but Fabianski says the players enjoy working under the 60-year-old.
"It's down to the chairman and down to the board to decide, but you can see things are working with him," he said.
"We're playing well and picked ourselves up, not only points-wise, but playing-wise as well.
"We've improved the way we play because in the first half of the season we struggled a bit.
Guidolin tight lipped over Swans future"You can clearly see that the work he has done has worked."
Guidolin has previously stated he and chairman Huw Jenkins have already started planning for next season, but does not know if he will be offered a new deal.
The Swans host Manchester City in their final game on Sunday, 15 May and Fabianski wants to end the campaign on a high against a side chasing a Champions League spot.
"We wanted to treat the remaining games in a serious manner and that's why we performed the way we performed," Fabianski added.
"They [Manchester City] have got plenty to play for and we've got something to play for as we still have a chance to climb up the table if results go for us.
"We want to finish well in front of our fans."
