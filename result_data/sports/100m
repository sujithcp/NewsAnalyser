Meanwhile, Stephanie Slater won the S8 100m butterfly and Charlotte Henshaw reclaimed the SB6 100m breaststroke title she won in 2009.

"A lot of my main rivals aren't European but it's always nice to come and test yourself.
You always want to perform well in those big finals and this is really good prep."
