Defending champions Yorkshire went top of the County Championship as they beat Surrey by an innings and 20 runs.
Needing to survive the day after Yorkshire declared on 557-6, Surrey were bowled out for 207 with four overs remaining at Headingley.
Joe Root (2-23) dismissed Kumar Sangakkara (61) and Steven Davies (52) to spark a collapse from 138-2.
Steven Patterson claimed three wickets after tea and Liam Plunkett sealed victory by removing Matt Dunn.
Early-morning rain meant Yorkshire had 84 overs to claim 10 wickets, and their task was made more challenging after England all-rounder David Willey was told not to bowl for six weeks because of an abdominal injury.
Surrey openers Rory Burns and Arun Harinath fell cheaply as Jack Brooks (3-65) and Plunkett struck with the new ball.
England batsman Root's part-time off-spin proved influential in the afternoon session as he had Sri Lankan Sangakkara caught at cover to end a third-wicket stand of 104 with Davies.
Jason Roy clipped the returning Brooks to mid-wicket before Root claimed a second wicket in three overs by trapping Davies lbw.
Although a further four overs were lost to rain after tea, Patterson bowled Tom Curran and Ben Foakes either side of having Gareth Batty caught behind during a fiery spell.
It left Ravi Rampaul and Dunn needing to survive 10.1 overs, but Plunkett's second wicket secured victory.
A maximum 24-point haul took Yorkshire one point clear of Lancashire, who beat Hampshire by an innings and 94 runs earlier on Wednesday.
