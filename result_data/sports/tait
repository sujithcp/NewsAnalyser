"Pleasure to welcome @shaun_tait32 to @KKRiders family.
Welcome Taity!," Kolkata chief executive Venky Mysore wrote on Twitter.
The 33-year-old speedster will join fellow Australians Chris Lynn and Brad Hogg at KKR, which is in a strong position to qualify for the playoffs.
Tait is set for a second IPL stint after previously representing the currently-suspended side Rajasthan Royals , where he picked up 23 wickets at an average of 27.82 in 21 matches.
Tait, who quit One-Day Internationals (ODI) in 2011, has made a mark on Twenty20 cricket with an impressive performance in Australia's Big Bash league (BBL).
He is known for bowling the second-fastest ball in cricket history, which clocked 161.1 kilometres per hour (100.1 miles per hour), in an ODI against England at Lord's in 2010.
All-rounder Hastings was earlier ruled out of the remainder of the tournament due to an ankle injury, which raised concerns about his fitness for Australia's upcoming tour of the West Indies, where they are scheduled to play a triangular ODI series alongside the hosts and South Africa.
The current edition of the Indian Premier League has seen several players pull out of the tournament due to injury concerns.
The MS Dhoni-led Rising Pune Supergiants (RPS) has been the worst-hit, losing the services of Kevin Pietersen, Faf du Plessis, Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh during its woeful campaign.
