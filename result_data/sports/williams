Rome: The Williams sisters are making another run for Olympic gold.
The winningest team in Olympic tennis history has entered the doubles draw at this week's Italian Open to kick off their preparations for the Rio de Janeiro Games.
It will mark the first time that Serena and Venus Williams have played doubles together since the 2014 U.S. Open.
Serena says, "Obviously we would love to play in the Olympics.
I love playing with Venus.
She's the best partner, and hopefully she feels the same about me.
We make a great team.
... Hopefully we'll be able to at least win a couple of matches here, just shake off the dust and keep playing."
