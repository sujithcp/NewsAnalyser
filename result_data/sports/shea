Harlequins will be motivated by the death of prop Seb Adeniran-Olule when they play the Challenge Cup final, according to Conor O'Shea.
Seb Adeniran-Olule represented England at three agre-gropu levelsHarlequins will be motivated by the death of prop Seb Adeniran-Olule when they meet Montpellier in the Challenge Cup final, according to director of rugby Conor O'Shea.
"They will be playing with huge motives," O'Shea told BBC Sport.
"What happened on Monday was heartbreaking.
They are going to play with Seb on their hearts."
Adeniran-Olule, who played three first-team games for Harlequins, had been with the club from the age of 13 and represented England at Under-16, Under-18 and Under-20 level.
"To say it was upsetting to see a life lost like that at the start of the week, would be an understatement," added O'Shea.
"That is emotional, but we have a group of experienced people who are used to emotion."
Captain Danny Care added: "It's probably been the hardest week I've faced as a rugby player, and probably in my life."
It will also be the final game in charge for O'Shea, who is to become head coach of the Italy national side.
"It's a cup final and we want to send Conor off in the right way, send him off to Italy hopefully with a trophy in his bag," added scrum-half Care.
"We do that for ourselves, and we do it for Seb."
Marler will return from his two-week ban for kicking Heguy and O'Shea said: "Joe's had a pretty tough couple of weeks but I look at him as a 25-year-old loose-head prop who could become anything over the next couple of years.
"His sheer physical presence on the pitch for us is massive: Marler to me is the best loosehead prop in European rugby.
"It has been an interesting challenge.
I didn't appoint him captain here for nothing, I didn't appoint him captain when he was a 17-year-old for an England under-18s team for nothing."
