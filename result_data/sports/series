A new 'North v South' of England one-day series, featuring players picked by a computer programme, has been unveiled by the England and Wales Cricket board.
The three-match series will be played in Abu Dhabi next March.
Five players for each side, including one spinner, will be selected using the Professional Cricketers' Association's Most Valued Player ratings formula.
The series will act as a warm-up for the County Championship's 50-over competition, the Royal London Cup.
An agreement has been signed to stage the series in the UAE for the next three years.
The PCA's MVP rankings were launched in 2007 and reward players for their contribution to the overall team result.
Batsmen receive points for run rate and percentage of team's score as well as bare average, while bowlers earn higher points for dismissing top-order batsmen.
The teams will be chosen using the MVP rankings from this summer's Royal London Cup, with the games aimed at uncapped or peripheral England players.
