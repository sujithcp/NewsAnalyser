Barasat: A fit-again Sony Norde returned with a double strike as Mohun Bagan stormed into the semi-final of Federation Cup football tournament with a 4-0 hammering of Salgaocar FC in their return leg on Thursday.
Captain Katsumi Yusa (25th minute) opened the scoring before Norde struck a brace (45+1st and 52nd), while Jeje Lalpekhula (90+4th) completed an aggregate 7-2 rout at the Vidyasagar Krirangan.

The Mariners had a 3-2 win in Goa in the first-leg of the quarter-final on Monday and they will clash against Shillong Lajong in the home and away leg semis on May 8 and 15.
Mohun Bagan almost sealed the deal in the first period with strikes from Norde and Yusa.
A wonderful run by Norde followed by a patient shot at goal by an unmarked Katsumi gifted Mohun Bagan a handsome 2-0 lead in front of an attendance of 10,242.
The Goans looked to equalise minutes later when Martin Scott took hold of Kingshuk Debnath's poor clearance to whip in a dangerous cross but their Cameroonian forward Calvin Mbarga's shot sailed over the bar.
A minute into the first-half injury time, Norde, who missed their last two matches including one in the AFC Cup because of his knee injury, showed his class as he collected a through-ball and sent it past the onrushing Salgaocar goalkeeper Karanjit Singh.
Norde's brilliance was for all to see again when the Haitian beat Nicolau Colaco and surged across the 18-yard box to send a curling shot which hit the far post before finding the back of the net.
The woodwork denied Salgaocar's back to back attempts in the 65th minute when captain Darryl Duffy headed it into the crosspiece before an action replay by Jackichand Singh.
In the fourth minute of second-half injury time, Jeje completed the hammering with a solitary effort to beat Karanjit with ease.
