Middlesex and Nottinghamshire's County Championship game at Lord's ended in a draw after no play was possible because of rain on the final two days.
The hosts were hoping to resume their first innings on 203-3, with England hopeful Sam Robson 114 not out, but play was called off at 14:25 BST.
Notts took 10 points from the game, with Middlesex claiming nine.
Middlesex have drawn all four of their games this season, with Notts having two draws, one win and one defeat.
Middlesex seamer Toby Roland-Jones:
"It's been a strange couple of days, sitting around and hoping for the weather to clear.
We looked like playing a few times, but it was not to be.
"Both sides would have looked at having a good first session, if there had been a resumption, to get the game going their way.
"But it was a steady wicket on which to bat so it would have been difficult for the bowlers."
Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell:
"It's a real shame to lose two full days of cricket, although I'm not sure where the game was going for us.
"Obviously, it looked as if we might have been facing a first-innings deficit, unless we had come back strongly with the ball and taken quick wickets if there had been a resumption.
"You never know, of course, but at this stage of the season we'll take the 10 points we get from the match and move on."
