| TNN | May 6, 2016, 12.08 PM ISTKOLKATA: It is not for nothing that Sony Norde is a darling of Mohun Bagan supporters.
The Haitian's magical touch was once again on view as he stamped authority on Salgaocar FC as Mohun Bagan won the second leg of their opening Federation Cup game 4-0 at the Barasat Stadium here on Thursday.Sony scored two and play ed a big role in Katsumi Yusa's opener.
Jeje Lalpekhlua netted the fourth as Bagan progressed to the semifinals 7-2 on aggregate.
They will meet Shillong Lajong FC in a double-leg semifinal.Sony, who missed Bagan's 3-2 win in the first leg in Goa because of an injury, returned to the starting XI on Thursday and made his presence felt right from the start.
He forced Salgaocar FC goal keeper Karanjit Singh into making a fine save just three minutes into the match with a sharp header.The visitors, desperate for an away goal, showed a lot of spunk and raided the Bagan box in quick succession.
Sony, however, calmed nerves in the Bagan dugout with a sublime piece of skill to lay the ball on a platter for Katsumi to open the scoring in the 25th minute.
Sony brilliantly controlled a poor pass from Lenny Rodrigues before darting run down the left flank.
He took three Salgaocar players in his stride before laying it off from near the byline.
His low cross beat the entire Salgaocar backline and Karanjit as it cut across the face of the goal only for Katsumi to place into the open net.Salgaocar had a chance to draw level on the night soon after, but Calvin Mbarga missed from point-blank range.
Bagan put the game beyond the Goan side just before the half-time break.Recommended By Colombia
