In the absence of star players, the remaining players have a massive hole to fill.
Having lost six of their eight matches so far, time is running out for the Supergiants.
TNN | May 5, 2016, 10.25 AM IST The Daredevils have turned the tables quite emphatically since their first match The Daredevils are coming off an impressive all-round performance against Gujarat Lions The Supergiants have been hampered by injury concerns
Time is running out for MS Dhoni and his team.
(AFP)NEW DELHI: Delhi Daredevils and Rising Pune Supergaints had a contrasting start to IPL 2016.
While the Daredevils began horrendously against Kolkata Knight Riders, Supergiants trumped defending champions Mumbai Indians in comprehensive fashion.
Four days short of a month since, both franchises are positioned at different end of the points-table.
The Daredevils, on the back of promising youngsters and an inspiring mentor in Rahul Dravid, have turned the tables quite emphatically.
Skipper Zaheer Khan has led from the front - he has combined figures of 4 for 48 in 7.3 overs in the last two matches - and the mix of young domestic batsmen and experienced international campaigners in Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and JP Duminy has handed them more than a chance of making it to the playoffs.
Add to that the fact that they've mostly been clinical in chasing and defending totals, and the Daredevils seem to have all bases covered.
Quite opposite have been the Supergiants.
As if their prime bowlers leaking runs wasn't enough, they've been marred by far too many injuries to key players.
From Kevin Petersen to the latest to join the casualty list Steven Smith, the Supergaints seem to be enduring an unfortunate run of events during the middle phase of the tournament.
In the absence of star players, the remaining players have a massive hole to fill.
Having lost six of their eight matches so far, time is running out for the Supergiants.
Left with very little to choose from, the team will bank on a good start from Ajinkya Rahane, new-entrant George Bailey and Usman Khawaja, apart from Dhoni himself in the middle order.
The Daredevils on the other hand, have won five out of seven - two of which were close encounters - and comprise the top three.
As the race for the playoff intensifies, every game from is of utmost importance.
Venue: Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, Delhi Date: May 05, 2016 Time: 20:00 IST Weather: Timely showers in the capital have dropped the temperature significantly.
Expect it to hower somewhere around 30 Degree Celsius
The Daredevils are coming off an impressive all-round performance against one of the stronger sides this season, Gujarat Lions.
Each player seems to be having a designated role in the team.
Hence, little reason for Daredevils to change their Playing XI.
Probable XI: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Rishabh Pant, 3 Sanju Samson, 4 Karun Nair, 5 Sam Billings, 6 JP Duminy, 7 Chris Morris, 8 Amit Mishra, 9 Mohammad Shami, 10 Zaheer Khan (capt), 11 Shahbaz Nadeem
Usman Khawaja and George Bailey have joined the Supergiants set-up as replacements for Mitchell Marsha and Steven Smith.
Both of them may be in with a chance considering Smith's unavailability and the lack of T20 specialists in their team.
Probable XI: 1 Ajinkya Rahane, 2 Usman Khawaja, 3 Saurabh Tiwary, 4 George Bailey, 5 MS Dhoni (capt/wk), 6 Thisara Perera, 7 Rajat Bhatia, 8 Scott Boland, 9 R Ashwin, 10 M Ashwin, 11 Ashok Dinda Quotes "You never know.
Some teams who are winning might lose and teams that are losing may win.
You can't judge any team at this stage of the tournament.
In T20 cricket, it can change any time.
It's all about momentum."
- Rajat Bhatia , Supergiants allrounder"Obviously, it's a good feeling to contribute something in team's victory, all the staff members and captain have confidence in me, faith in me and I just justified their confidence and faith," Pant said after Daredevils beat Lions by eight wickets here last night."
