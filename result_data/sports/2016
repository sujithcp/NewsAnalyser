West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle made headlines in the previous season of Big Bash League (BBL) for his embarrassing punch line ‘Don’t blush, Baby’ on Television presenter Mel McLaughlin.
Gayle, who played for Melbourne Renegades, was outrageously criticised by the Australian media as well former cricketers.
He was fined $10,000 and was later highly condemned by CA chief executive James Sutherland, who termed it as workplace harassment.
There were reports that Gayle won’t be allowed to further participate in this league.
However, his West Indian counterpart Dwayne Bravo is likely to be the new marquee player for Melbourne Renegades for the next season of BBL.

“We’ll be in a better position to confirm our international signings in the weeks and months ahead.
I’m aware of speculation but we’ll make those decisions in the best interests of our club overall,” Stuart Coventry, the Melbourne Renegades chief executive, told The Daily Telegraph .
However, according to the reports by daily, other franchises as well have not considered signing Gayle yet.
Nonetheless, Renegades coach David Saker did not guarantee Gayle’s re-signing.
“To be fair we probably need an overseas bowler though.
We’re looking at whether to go down that track or to recruit a bowler from inside Australia.
So we’re going through whether we need to re-sign Chris Gayle,” he told The Age .
