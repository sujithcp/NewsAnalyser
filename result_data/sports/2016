NEW DELHI: A look at the key passages of play from Match 33 of the Indian Premier League season nine, in which Rising Pune Supergiants beat Delhi Daredevils by seven wickets at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi on Thursday.
With three victories in nine games, Pune are placed at sixth in the standings, whereas Delhi remain at third after five wins in eight games.
Delhi struggle in first half Sent in to bat, Delhi lost three wickets at regular intervals to score a below par 69/3 after 10 overs.
They lost opener Rishabh Pant early in the third over, clean bowled by Pune pacer Ashok Dinda.
Karun Nair and Sanju Samson steadied the innings, before Scott Boland dismissed Samson for 20, and reduced the hosts to 48/2 in six overs.
Soon, Delhi lost another wicket when Rajat Bhatia dismissed Nair in the tenth over.
Nair scored a brisk 32 off 23 balls, which included five fours.
Billings, Brathwaite raise the tempo Sam Billings joined stand-in skipper JP Duminy in the middle and revived the Delhi innings with some big shots in the second half.
Billings smacked two back-to-back sixes off Ravichandran Ashwin in the 13th over to take Delhi past the 100-run mark.
But Bhatia came back in the 15th over and gave Pune an important break when he dismissed Billings.
The Englishman hit two sixes and a four in his 15-ball 24 cameo and added 45 runs for the fourth wicket with his captain.
Carlos Brathwaite then took little time to settle down as he hit two sixes off Murugan Ashwin in the next over to maintain the momentum set by Billings.
But the big West Indian didn't last long as he hit one straight to Perera at deep backward square leg off Boland in the 17th over, soon after hitting another six over long-off.
Brathwaite scored 20 off just eight balls during his whirlwind knock.
Two run-outs leave Delhi short Two run-outs in six balls, soon after Brathwaite's wicket, left Delhi at 143/7 after 17.5 overs.
First, Duminy fell short of the crease while trying to steal a second run and in the next over, Saurabh Tiwary's direct hit sent Jayant Yadav back to the dugout.
Pawan Negi, 19* off 12 balls, hit a six and a four in the final over off Dinda to push the total to 162/7.
Duminy top-scored for Delhi with a watchful 34 off 32 balls, which included just one boundary.
Rahane, Khawaja set the tone Chasing a competitive target, in-form Ajinkya Rahane and Usman Khawaja gave Pune a solid start, taking them to 50 for no loss after the Powerplay overs.
Between them, the duo hit a six and six fours during the field restrictions.
After two boundary-less overs, veteran legspinner Amit Mishra provided Delhi with their first breakthrough when he dismissed Khawaja in the ninth over.
The Australian, trying to up the ante, charged forward but missed the ball completely and gave away a simple stumping chance to Samson.
He contributed 30 off 27 balls with the help of a six and two fours on IPL debut.
Rahane fifty & Dhoni, Perera cameos Rahane guided Pune to 74/1 at the halfway stage of their chase.
Pune lost their second wicket after going past 100 runs, when Billings took a diving catch to dismiss Saurabh Tiwary off Imran Tahir in the 14th over.
Tiwary hit a six and a four in his 18-ball 21 cameo and added 45 runs with Rahane, who completed his fifth fifty of the season off 38 balls.
Tahir and Mishra then squeezed the run-flow, giving away just 20 runs during the middle overs (13-17), which left Pune needing 37 more from the final three.
Dhoni hit a four and a six in consecutive balls off Mohammed Shami in the 18th to reduce the equation to 17 runs off 12 balls, before Billings took another stunning catch at deep mid-wicket to dismiss Dhoni, who scored 27 off 20 balls.
Perera then hit two sixes off Tahir in the penultimate over to take Pune on the verge of victory.
Rahane finished off the chase in style with a four and remained unbeaten on 63 off 48 balls.Recommended By Colombia
