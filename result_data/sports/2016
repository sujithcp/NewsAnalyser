Virat Kohli has admitted that he has everything planned in his house that reduces the number of outings he has to make because going out of the house even for a meal is like a huge mission for him.
“When I think of having a house, I think of having everything inside it … because for me going out of the house even to have a meal is like a mission.
It used to irritate me, but I’ve come to accept the fact I have to stay in the house.
It takes a lot of planning to go out,” he added.
However, a young Kohli has managed to keep himself calm despite seeing unbelievable fame at such a young age.

According to edition.cnn.com , Kohli spoke about the temper issues he has been having for a very long time.
His passion for cricket on-field has always been confused with an unnecessary form of aggression.
Nevertheless, the Indian Test skipper admitted that he has worked on it hard and his temper has been reduced to a great extent.
“My temper has been an issue for me.
It’s been very hard to control at times,” he said.
In February, Kohli was fined 30 per cent of his match fee for having a confrontation with the umpire after he was given leg before wicket during India’s match against Pakistan in Asia Cup T20 2016.
However, that was the same match when Kohli displayed one of the best knocks of his career.
While Mohammad Aamer had derailed the Indian line-up, Kohli stood alone and with a half-century he ensured India did not lose against their arch rivals.
It is a known fact that a Kohli’s transformation as a person and a cricketer took place after the sudden demise of his father when he was just 18.
His father had a massive heart attack around 3am and he died.
Kohli was 40 not out overnight, in the grip of a game.
“I called my [Delhi] coach in the morning.
I said I wanted to play, because for me not completing a cricket game is a sin.
That was a moment that changed me as a person.
The importance this sport holds in my life is very, very high,” Kohli recalled those tough times that made him strong forever.
