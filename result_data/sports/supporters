Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell shows off the rail seat technologyCeltic will introduce a safe-standing area from the start of next season.
The club confirmed in their season-ticket renewal information that rail seats are to be installed at Celtic Park over the summer.
The modified area will be in the corner of the Lisbon Lions Stand.
Permission was granted in June last year, with the model being used based on versatile seating common at German grounds.
Their initial plans were to accommodate up to 2,600 supporters.
Glasgow City Council, which had twice previously rejected applications from the Scottish champions, gave the project its approval in June last year.
At the time, Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: "Across football globally, the reality is that some supporters are choosing to stand at matches.
"Rail seating has been in place in European football for some time and there has been considerable demand for some form of safe standing within the UK and particularly from our supporters."
