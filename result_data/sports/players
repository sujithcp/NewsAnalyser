Sona Chaudhary, former captain of the Indian women football team, narrates tales of sexual exploitation in her latest book.
Titled 'Game in Game', Sona alleges in the book how team management, coach and secretary harassed the female players of the squad.
In the book recently launched in Varanasi, Sona wrote about the shameful incidents that happened with the players when she used to be an active national footballer.
She alleged that the management staff of the team used to force the players to compromise for a place in the squad, also revealing that to avoid getting harassed and abused, players acted like lesbians.
The ex-captain said that the exploitation is across all levels, whether it is a state team or the national team.
The players have to face mental torture as well as adjust to certain compromises.
She also revealed that during away tours, the beds of coaches and other staff members were placed in players' rooms despite the complaints made to authorities.
Sona suffered a career-ending injury to her knee and backbone in the 1998 Asia Cup.
After successful surgery, she settled in Varanasi in 2002, announcing premature retirement.
Sports Minister Sarbanda Sonowal has also issued a statement on the allegation levied by Sona, saying the Ministry would investigate if a written complaint is filed.
“If we get any complaint we always take steps, ur ministry always take steps,” the minister told media on Thursday.
