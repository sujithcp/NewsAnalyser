Mike Phillips made the first of his 94 Wales appearances against Romania in 2003Former Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips says he could finish his playing career at Sale Sharks.
Phillips was asked by Scrum V Radio if Sale could be the last club he plays for before retiring.
"I don't know - I'll see how it goes really, see how the body feels and see how I perform," said the five-cap British and Irish Lions player.
"I guess I'll be able to tell a few months into it."
Carmarthen-born Phillips has also played for Bayonne, Ospreys, Cardiff Blues and Scarlets.
Wales' most-capped scrum-half, who retired from international rugby in December 2015, will return to Britain after five years in France.
"I've enjoyed every minute of it," Phillips said.
"I really wanted to go back and finish my career in the UK and hopefully finish on a high.
"I've had a chat with a few guys who have played there and obviously the coaching staff and they were really positive.
"I think it's a club moving in the right direction."
