The 35-year-old made his 98th Warriors appearance as a second-half replacement in Saturday's 14-7 loss at Connacht.

"I want to keep on playing and I'm glad I get to extend my time at a club which I really enjoy representing."
The winger featured in three Six Nations matches this year, starting against Wales and coming off the bench twice.
