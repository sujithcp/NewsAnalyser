Wladimir Klitschko will defend his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles against American challenger Tony Thompson on 7 July in Berne, Switzerland.
However, the 36-year-old Ukrainian maintains Thompson gave him "one of the toughest challenges in my career".
Southpaw Thompson, who has won all five bouts since the defeat by Klitschko, has a career record of 36-2 (24 KOs).
