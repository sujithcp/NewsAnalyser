Edinburgh beat Ospreys 24-16 at Myreside in February 2015Edinburgh will play their home matches at Myreside for the second half of next season.
The Pro12 side are to switch from Murrayfield from January to May with a view to playing the 2017-18 campaign at the George Watson's College ground.
Myreside's capacity is to be increased with the use of temporary stands.
Edinburgh used the venue in the early years of professionalism and last played a match there during the 2015 Six Nations.
"This is about building a strong future for the club at a home ground in the city that better suits our needs and improves the match day experience for fans and players alike," said Edinburgh managing director Jonny Petrie.
"I'd like to thank George Watson's College for proposing the idea and for their support in working with us to develop the concept into a credible plan.
"We will now be liaising closely with all relevant parties to ensure a smooth transition over the coming months."
Work will now start on bringing the facilities at the home of Premiership club Watsonians up to pro-level standards.
Murrayfield is the home of the national side with a capacity of 67,500 and the atmosphere for Edinburgh matches has often been lacking.
Edinburgh finished a disappointing ninth in the Pro12, having won just three out of 10 matches since their back-to-back successes against defending champions Glasgow Warriors over the festive season.
