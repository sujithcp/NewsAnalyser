What does one do to prove that they are not disabled, but just differently abled?
In the case of U Mohammad Shareef, he decided to pick up a bat.
“Disabled cricket has existed for the last 30 years.
I started playing in 1991, and 10 years later, became captain of the team.
It was the same time Azharuddin was the captain of the Indian team and Poornima Rao led the women’s team,” beams Shareef, who is currently the general secretary, Challengers Cricket Club for the disabled.
Last year, the club went international, when Hyderabad hosted a T20 showdown between the Indian, Pakistani and Sri Lankan teams.
This year, two months ahead of their T20 match with Pakistan in Chennai and two others in Bellary, Karnataka, they are taking on a team drawn from the Fellowship of Cricket Loving Rotarians.
“We want to show people what we are capable of.
That’s why, for the past two years, we’ve been playing exhibition matches with abled people, and only the professional ones with differently-abled teams,” says Shareef.
Even though the disabled cricket team has been gaining momentum in the last couple of years, they still have a grouse.
“The Pakistan team is supported by their cricket board and the same is true for the Bangladesh team.
We, however, don’t have that, even though we’ve been requesting for the same.” Their main sponsors, says Shareef, are students.
Funds for the matches are collected largely through drop boxes placed in educational institutions.
“Cricket is a game that creates a craze in India.
Watch the match to know why we deserve support.”
Rotary Club of Madras Central, in association with Challengers Cricket Club for the disabled, presents the Rotary Challengers Trophy.
The match will be held at Loyola College cricket ground from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. tomorrow.
Entry is free.
