A hearing to make trial arrangements in respect of Mr Evans, 27 will be held at Mold Crown Court on 27 May.
The striker was originally convicted in April 2012 of raping a woman, 19, at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire.
The former Sheffield United, Manchester City and Norwich player was released from jail in October 2014 after serving half of his five-year term.
He always denied raping the woman.
Mr Evans' case was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice in Wales, England and Northern Ireland.
Judges said they had heard fresh evidence during the hearing on 22 and 23 March.
The footballer has not been signed by a new club since his release from prison.
