Melbourne Renegades are unlikely to re-sign Chris Gayle, to all but end the West Indian's Big Bash League (BBL) prospects next season.
According to a report in The Daily Telegraph on Thursday (May 5), the Renegades have officially turned their back on Gayle and are set to announce Dwayne Bravo, the West Indian all-rounder, as their new marquee player.
"We'll be in a better position to confirm our international signings in the weeks and months ahead," Stuart Coventry, the Renegades chief executive, told The Daily Telegraph.
"I'm aware of speculation but we'll make those decisions in the best interests of our club overall."
Gayle's "don't blush, baby" remark during a live interview with television reporter Mel McLaughlin plunged the BBL, which was in the midst of a watershed season, into scandal and an embarrassing punchline.
The 36-year-old's BBL future was uncertain but James Sutherland, Cricket Australia chief executive, recently said Gayle won't be prevented from signing with a BBL franchise.
According to the daily, no other BBL franchise is considering signing Gayle.
On Wednesday, David Saker, the Renegades coach, said Gayle was "still a chance" of being invited back to the Renegades although their recruiting emphasis would be to target a bowler.
"To be fair we probably need an overseas bowler," he said to The Age.
"We're looking at whether to go down that track or to recruit a bowler from inside Australia.
So we're going through whether we need to re-sign Chris Gayle."
