Sam Robson hit his third consecutive century at Lord's as Middlesex profited in the sun against Nottinghamshire.
The visitors, 345-7 overnight, were bowled out for 354 as they lost their last three wickets for only nine runs.
Robson, 26, who hopes to earn an England recall for the Test series against Sir Lanka, hit 17 fours to finish unbeaten on 114.
England batsman Nick Compton fell lbw to Brett Hutton for three as the hosts closed on 203-3, trailing by 151 runs.
Compton made nought, 44, 38, one and 14 not out in his previous five innings and his lack of a big score could count against him when the selectors meet later this week.
Toby Roland Jones earlier claimed his first five-wicket haul for Middlesex this season as he had Samit Patel (86) caught by Dawid Malan at deep square leg and bowled Harry Gurney for a duck.
The hosts were quickly reduced to 49-3 in reply as Stuart Broad bowled Nick Gubbins and Hutton dismissed Compton and Malan with consecutive balls.
However, Robson calmly rebuilt Middlesex's innings alongside wicketkeeper John Simpson (66 not out) and reached a hard-fought century off 194 balls.
They shared an unbroken 154-run fourth-wicket partnership before bad light and rain stopped play prematurely.
