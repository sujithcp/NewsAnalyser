George Bailey played five Test matches for AustraliaAustralia international batsman George Bailey will join Middlesex from the end of June to cover the mid-summer loss of overseas player Adam Voges.
The 33-year-old, who has played 71 one-day and 28 T20 matches for Australia, is available for part of Middlesex's T20 Blast and One-Day Cup group stages.
Bailey averages 41.63 in ODIs and 26.11 in T20Is and previously captained Australia's one-day squad.
Voges is set to play in Australia's Tests against Sri Lanka this summer.
New Zealand's Brendon McCullum will join the county when his Indian Premier League stint comes to an end and stay until 25 June, while his fellow Kiwi Mitchell McClenaghan will also join after the IPL.
"Obtaining high quality overseas player cover for an entire season is extremely difficult and everyone at Middlesex is delighted that we have been able to acquire the services of a player of George's ability," said managing director of cricket Angus Fraser.
"George is an outstanding cricketer with an excellent record in all forms of the game and, as someone who has captained his country, he will be a valuable addition to the squad both on and off the field."
