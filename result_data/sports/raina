Suresh Raina will fly to Holland.
(Sports: BCCI)India batsman Suresh Raina holds the record for not missing an Indian Premier League (IPL) match since its inception in 2008 but the left hander may finally miss a game as he is expecting the birth of his first child in Holland.

Raina, under whom the Gujarat Lions beat hosts Kolkata Knight Riders by five wickets in Kolkata on Sunday, said that he will fly to Holland on Monday to be with his pregnant wife Priyanka Chaudhary.
“I’m flying to Holland to meet my wife tomorrow and I’m all excited,” Raina said at the post-match interview at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.
Having played the most number of games in the cash-rich league, the southpaw is also the leading run-getter.
In 143 games, he has amassed 3985 runs at an average of 33.48.
The Uttar Pradesh batsman, who played for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the first seven years, was named skipper of the newly-formed Gujarat franchise after CSK was banned from the IPL for two seasons on charges of corruption.
Raina’s non-availability could mean that either Brendon McCullum or Aaron Finch could lead the Lions in their next game against Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium on May 14.
