Robertson called the decision "absolutely nuts"World Snooker has added the one-frame Shoot Out tournament to its ranking events for next season but the decision has been criticised by some players.
Matches at the tournament, which began in 2011, are played over one frame, lasting a maximum of 10 minutes.
The event features a shot clock of 15 seconds for the first five minutes and 10 seconds for the last five, with players often running around the table.
"Absolutely nuts.
A huge slap in the face to any player who has actually won a proper ranking event," Robertson said.
Ebdon said: "Somebody please tell me this is a complete wind-up."
The tournament, which will take place from 24 to 26 February, will also be open to all 128 World Snooker Tour players this year, rather than the top 64 seeds who enter, as has been the case in previous years.
"The Shoot Out is all about who can handle the pressure and think fast when the clock is ticking," World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn said.
"That pressure will be intensified now that every pound earned counts towards the ranking list."
