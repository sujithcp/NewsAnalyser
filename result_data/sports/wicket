(Source: BCCI)Yuvraj Singh has been called the ‘sixer king’ but there is something new that can be related to him and the term six.

Here are the other five
In 2008, Mumbai Indians batsman gave up his wicket to Kings XI Pujab bowler S. Sreesanth.
Misbah-ul-Haq in 2008 while donning Royal Challengers Bangalore was up against Sreesanth who showed Misbah way back to the pavilion after dismissing the Pakistan batsman in this particular fashion.
Swapnil Asnodkar while playing for his franchise team Rajasthan Royals in 2009 gave away his wicket to Albie Morkel.
He was hit wicket by the Chennai Super Kings’ quick bowler.
Ravindra Jadeja in 2012 was a part of Chennai Super Kings.
He was up against his current Gujarat Lions teammate Dale Steyn.
Steyn is considered as one of the most ferocious bowlers but Jadeja didn’t allow him to show his skills as the left-arm batsman went back in the hut after getting out hit wicket.
Saurabh Tiwary in 2012 got out in this fashion while facing Mumbai Indians spinner Harbhajan Singh.
