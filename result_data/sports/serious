Jockey Jason Maguire, who won the Grand National on Ballabriggs in 2011, is to retire aged 36 after serious injuries.
The Irishman has not ridden competitively since February 2015 after a fall at Musselburgh.
Maguire suffered a serious injury a year earlier which left him in an induced coma.
Agent Chris Broad said: "He was a top-class rider - it wasn't long ago that he split AP McCoy and Richard Johnson in the championship."
