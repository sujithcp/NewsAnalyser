Kawasaki: Justin Gatlin of the United States clocked 10.02 seconds to win the 100 meters at a Golden Grand Prix event on Sunday.
Gatlin crossed the finish line .19 seconds ahead of Japan's Ryota Yamagata and Ramon Gittens of Barbados who clocked 10.26.
"The race felt good," Gatlin said.
"I knew that I was going to have a headwind after practice yesterday.
I talked to my coach over the phone and he told me to just go through and have a good start and finish the race."
Gatlin said he was pleased with the way he is running at this point in the season as he prepares to challenge Usain Bolt at the Rio Olympics.
"My coach wants me to just ease myself into the season," Gatlin said.
"We have a long season ahead of us.
Olympic trials will hopefully be a mirror image of the Olympics so I'm gonna be running a lot and I don't want to start the season so fast with such high intensity."
Tianna Bartoletta of the United States won the women's 100 with a time of 11.23, .07 seconds ahead of Blessing Okagbare of Nigeria.
Barbara Pierre, also of the U.S., was third in 11.40.
Bartoletta is the world champion in the long jump and won that event with a leap of 6.61 meters, beating Australia's Brooke Stratton (6.55) and Xu Xiaoling of China who was third with a jump of 6.47.
Xie Wenjun of China won the men's 110-meter hurdles with a time of 13.36, .23 seconds ahead of compatriot Zhang Honglin.
Hideki Omuro of Japan was third with a time of 13.61.
World champion Shawn Barber of Canada won the pole vault, clearing 5.62 meters.
