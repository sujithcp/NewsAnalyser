Marlow, England: Indian women hockey team's disappointing show continued against Great Britain as the visitors on Monday suffered another humiliating loss, going down 0-7 in the final game of the five-match series in Marlow, England.
Great Britain opened the scoring in the 12th minute when Shona McCallin broke into the Indian defence and netted the ball.
Continuing their dominating show, the hosts earned two penalty corners in the first quarter, but were denied from adding to their tally, courtesy of some brilliant defence from the Indian eves.
A similar flurry of attacks in the second quarter again won the home team two back-to-back penalty corners, but India's defence held strong to deny them another goal.
Meanwhile, Indian girls, too, had their chance to equalise via a penalty corner but they failed to convert.
Just when it looked like the Indian women were getting back into the game, Great Britain added to their tally by converting a penalty corner.
The second goal was scored by Susannah Townsend in 28th minute via a rebound.
At half time Great Britain were leading 2-0.
They kept pressing and won yet another penalty corner just after the half time, which they managed to convert through Crista Cullen in the 38th minute.
Thereafter, Great Britain completely unleashed their attacking prowess and scored two more goals in quick succession.
One of them came via a penalty corner by Kate Walsh in the 42nd minute and the other was scored by Helen Walsh in the 44th minute.
At the end of the third quarter, Great Britain were leading 5-0.
But that was not the end to India's misery as Susannah Townsend netted the ball twice in the final minutes of the match to finish with as many as seven goals.
