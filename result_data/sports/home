Building work has already begun next to White Hart Lane to prepare for a new stadiumTottenham are close to a deal to play home games at Wembley in the 2017-18 season, says Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.
Spurs, who are having a new Â£400m stadium built next to their existing home White Hart Lane, could also play next season's home Champions League games at the national stadium.
They aim to move into their new 61,000-seat home before the 2018-19 season.
"We're a long way down the path on reaching an agreement," Dyke said.
"I think there's some discussion about whether they'll play their Champions League games there at Wembley next year but I don't know much about that."
Tottenham's north-London rivals Arsenal hosted Champions League games at Wembley in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
Dyke also said Chelsea could play home games at Wembley in the near future.
The Blues have plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge, which could leave them needing a temporary home for several seasons.
"I think Chelsea might come for a longer period," he told Sky Sports News HQ.
"Chelsea have got really exciting plans for their stadium.
They're going to demolish the whole thing and build a whole new stadium on the existing site.
"If they came to Wembley, that would mean them coming for three years."
