Exeter's win at Harlequins was their biggest away win in the Premiership since they won 52-0 at London Welsh on the opening day of last seasonExeter must focus on giving their best-ever Premiership performance in the play-offs, says boss Rob Baxter.
"Our whole focus shouldn't necessarily be on Wasps or the Premiership or getting to finals.
"It should be playing our best game that we've ever played in the Premiership, because the semi-final should deserve that," said Baxter.

Exeter will host the Coventry-based club in their fourth meeting of the season later this month as they vie to reach the Premiership final.
"We have only lost one game at home, so we haven't been taking things for granted or else we would have lost more," Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
"We've been very focused at home, but it's going to be our jobs as coaches, and the senior players' jobs, to get everyone back on track and everyone back on lien to make sure everyone gets the hard work done that needs to get done over the next two weeks to make sure we platy our best game of rugby of the season."
