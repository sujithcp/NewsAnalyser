Nazil took nine wickets in an innings in an inter-KCA-academy match.
On Wednesday at Perinthalmanna, he did even better.
Opening the bowling for Kannur, he took all the 10 wickets of Malappuram in the North Zone (under-19) inter-District cricket championship.
And did all the damage in one devastating spell of swing bowling.
His figures read 9.4-4-12-10, as the host, batting first, was dismissed for a paltry 26.
“It was after taking my seventh wicket that I began to think of the ten-wicket haul,” Nazil told The Hindu .
“This is of course something you could never have imagined.”
Swinging it He said the conditions had helped on this day.
“Since play begun at 7.15, because of the extreme heat, I could get some swing,” he said.
“But it was only in my fourth over that I got my first wicket.
I was able to in-swing the ball well.”
Not surprisingly, he got four of his wickets through lbw, and bowled three batsmen.
“My focus has always been on swing,” the 18-year-old said.
“Bhuvneshwar Kumar is my favourite bowler.”
