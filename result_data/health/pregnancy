Could diet soda be fueling the rise of childhood obesity?
A new study of more than 3,000 Canadian children and their mothers finds a strong
link between the amount of artificially sweetened beverages the women drank during pregnancy and
the body mass index of their babies.
Compared with women who stayed away from the drinks while they were pregnant,
those who consumed them on a daily basis were twice as likely to have their babies classified as
overweight when they celebrated their first birthday, according to a report published Monday in
JAMA Pediatrics.
Researchers also found that when mothers had a daily habit of drinking beverages
flavored with artificial sweeteners during pregnancy, their 1-year-olds had BMI z-scores that were
significantly higher than those of their counterparts.
(The z-score is a statistic that measures
how much a child’s BMI deviates from the average for children of the same age and gender.)
However, the researchers could not find any link between consumption of
high-calorie sugar-sweetened beverages during pregnancy and the risk that a baby would be
overweight at age 1.
“To our knowledge, our results provide the first human evidence that artificial
sweetener consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of early childhood overweight,” wrote
the authors of the study, which was led by Meghan Azad of the University of Manitoba in Canada.
Some evidence for a link between prenatal exposure to artificial sweeteners and
excess weight gain after birth has been found in animals, the authors noted.
