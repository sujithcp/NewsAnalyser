After DEA agents obtained a search warrant for Prince's Paisley Park estate Tuesday, it was revealed who the doctor was who had treated him in the weeks ahead of his death , according to reports.
Having reportedly seen the singer the day before he died (April 20), Doctor Michael T. Schulenberg had just arrived at Prince's home with test results on April 21 only to find that the music legend had been pronounced dead moments earlier, according to a police affidavit – filed in connection with a search warrant – obtained by The New York Times .
Dr. Schulenberg also reportedly saw Prince in the weeks before his death on the same day that he cancelled an Atlanta show due to illness.
Although Prince was said to have been battling the flu , the papers do not disclose which illness he was diagnosed with, but they do say that Schulenberg performed tests and prescribed the singer with medication.
According to the Los Angeles Times , the search warrant also requested medical records from the North Memorial Medical Center where Schulenberg was formerly employed.
The day after the musician's death an autopsy was performed and while the tests have been completed, an official cause of death has not been released.
