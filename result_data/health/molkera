TNN | May 11, 2016, 07.59 AM IST Kalaburagi: Culling operations began at a private poultry farm at Molkera village in Humanabad taluk, Bidar district, at 5.30pm on Tuesday.
The operation has been launched after bird flu was detected two days ago.
The drive to kill 1.5 lakh chickens will end in the midnight, said DC Anurag Tiwari.
About 400 trained personnel and 40 doctors are involved in the operation.
The drive was supposed to start at 6am, but was delayed as a medical check-up of workers consumed much time.
Also, the removal of rainwater from burial pits at the farm continued till noon.
Ten pits of 40-ft length, 6-ft width and 6-ft depth have been dug up to bury chickens which will be loaded in around 300 bags.
A two-member team from the central government, headed by Naveen Gupta, visited Molkera and surrounding areas to educate villagers on bird flu, precautions and suggested cure for symptoms.
A separate ward has been opened at the taluk hospital.Recommended By Colombia
