May 5, 2016 -- The FDA will bar the sales of e-cigarettes, cigars , and hookah tobacco to anyone under 18.
The agency announced new rules Thursday that add those products to laws covering the sale of other tobacco items like cigarettes.
It says the move is aimed at reducing the number of teens who use them.
A recent survey showed that e-cigarette use among high school students has risen from 1.5% in 2011 to 16% in 2015, the FDA says.
Hookah use has also risen.
The rule changes take effect in 90 days.
The key regulations:
Set 18 as the age when users can legally buy products, including online purchases Require a photo ID as proof of age Don't allow products to be sold in vending machines (barring those in adult-only facilities) Don't allow free samples to be distributed
E-cigarettes and cigars will also carry health warning labels.
Other parts of the rule changes may take years to put into effect.
The change is “a foundational step that enables the FDA to regulate products young people were using at alarming rates, like e-cigarettes, cigars, and hookah tobacco, that had gone largely unregulated,” says Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, in a statement.
In 2015, 3 million middle- and high-school students reported being "current" e-cigarette users.
“As cigarette smoking among those under 18 has fallen, the use of other nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, has taken a drastic leap.
All of this is creating a new generation of Americans who are at risk of addiction,” Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell says in a statement.
In a news conference Thursday, Zeller compared the e-cig marketplace to “the Wild, Wild West.”
He noted there have been reports of people burned and disfigured by e-cigarette battery explosions.
The products have a battery, a heating element, and a cartridge that holds nicotine and other liquids and flavorings.
Users exhale vapor instead of smoke, in what's called “vaping.”
Manufacturers claim e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, but opponents say they may also encourage people to pick up a habit and become nicotine addicts.
A recent study also found that e-cigs didn't help cigarette smokers kick the habit.
