SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — An outbreak of listeria across three states, including California, has prompted a massive nationwide recall of frozen organic and non-organic vegetables.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list that includes 358 products under 42 different brands sold at grocery stores including Safeway, Trader Joe’s and Costco.
The products may be contaminated with deadly Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.
The frozen fruits and vegetables on the list were sold in all 50 states and parts of Canada.
So far 8 people have been hospitalized.
Two patients later died from other causes according to the CDC.
The items were packaged by CRF Frozen Foods in Washington state.
The company issued voluntary recall in April and suspended operations at its plant in Pasco.
On May 4, CRF expanded the recall to include all of its organic fruits and vegetables.
Customers who purchased the products should throw them out or return them to the point of sale for a refund.
Products include but are not limited to: organic and non-organic broccoli, butternut squash, carrots, cauliflower, corn, edamame, green beans, Italian beans, kale, leeks, lima beans, onions, peas, pepper strips, potatoes, potato medley, root medley, spinach, sweet potatoes, various vegetable medleys, blends, and stir fry packages, blueberries, cherries, cranberries, peaches, raspberries, and strawberries.
The products were processed at the CRF facility since May 1, 2014 and have sell by dates between April 26, 2016 and April 26, 2018.
In a press release , CRF apologized to consumers for the inconvenience and warned:
“Listeria can cause “serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.”
Costco and Trader Joe’s have issued recalls covering their affected products, as well.
