April 27, 2016 -- A recall of Pilgrim's Pride fully cooked chicken products due to possible contamination with foreign objects such as plastic, wood, rubber and metal has been expanded to more than 4.5 million pounds of products.
An initial recall on April 7 covered about 40,700 pounds of fully cooked chicken nuggets produced on Oct. 5, 2015.
The new recall covers a variety of chicken products produced between Aug. 21, 2014 to March 1, 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said Tuesday.
There are no confirmed reports of consumers suffering harm after eating the recalled products, but anyone concerned about a possible illness or injury should contact a health care provider, government officials said.
Consumers with the recalled products should throw them away or return them to the place of purchase, FSIS advised.
