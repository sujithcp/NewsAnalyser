Ice cream maker Blue Bell Creameries has issued another recall, this time for pints mistakenly packaged as the wrong flavor of ice cream.
Blue Bell recalled all of its products everywhere after a large listeria outbreak in 2015.
The company said it is now recalling select shipments Rocky Road ice cream pints made in Brenham because they may actually contain the company's Cookies n' Cream flavor.
The Cookies 'n Cream flavor contains the undeclared allergens soy and wheat.
No illnesses have been reported, but Blue Bell acknowledges the presence of soy and wheat could pose serious health risks to those who are allergic, according to a recall notice filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
There are no other health or safety concerns with the ice cream.
The recalled pints were distributed in Texas and Louisiana throughout retail outlets, including food service operators, convenience stores and supermarkets, the company said.
The mix-up was brought to light after a Blue Bell employee noticed incorrect packaging while restocking a retailer.
The recalled pints have containers marked as Rocky Road ice cream, but Cookies n' Cream lids, according to the notice.
Affected product also has the following code printed on the bottom of the pint: 022918576.
It has been five months since Blue Bell returned to shelves in Louisiana.
The company stopped production at plants in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama after contaminated Blue Bell ice cream was linked to 10 cases of listeria in four states, including three deaths at a Kansas hospital.
