Would-be-mothers please take note!
IANS | May 5, 2016, 05.21 PM ISTCosmetics may not be safe during pregnancy (Getty Images)Would-be-mothers please take note!
Using personal care products such as soaps and lotions during pregnancy may lead to adverse reproductive effects in your newborns, warns a new study.The findings revealed a link between women who use cosmetics with higher levels of butyl paraben -- commonly used preservative in cosmetics -- to shorter gestational age at birth, decreased birth weight and increased odds of preterm birth.
"The antimicrobial compound -- triclocarban -- mainly added to soaps, is associated with shorter gestational age at birth.
Another common chemical added to lotions and creams -- propyl paraben -- is associated with decreased body length at birth," said Laura Geer from SUNY Downstate Medical Centre in New York, US.
"Our latest study adds to the growing body of evidence showing that endocrine-disrupting compounds can lead to developmental and reproductive problems in animals and in humans," Geer added in a paper published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.
"Based on this new evidence, the safety of use of these chemicals in our consumer products should be reassessed," Geer pointed out.
"While small-scale changes in birth size may not be of clinical relevance or cause for concern in individual cases, subtle shifts in birth size or timing at the population-level would have major impacts on the risk for adverse birth outcomes," Geer noted.
What causes appetite loss during illness (13:40) New York, May 5 (IANS) Researchers have discovered how an immune system molecule hijacks a brain circuit and reduces appetite when you are inflicted with an illness.
While loss of appetite during illness is common, it contributes to reducing a patient's strength and in cancer patients, it can even shorten lifespan.
The new research points to potential targets for treating loss of appetite and restoring a patient's strength.
"Treating loss of appetite won't cure an underlying disease, but it could help a patient cope," said senior author of the study Bruno Conti, professor at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in California, US.
"Many times, loss of appetite can compromise clinical outcome.
A weak individual is less likely to be able to cope with chemotherapy, for instance," Conti said.
Many people recover their appetite after illness.
But in patients with diseases such as cancer or AIDS, loss of appetite can turn into a wasting disease called cachexia, also known as "the last illness" because it can accelerate a patient's decline.
The findings were published in The Journal of Neuroscience.
The researchers believe the circuit affected by an immune molecule called interleukin 18 (IL-18) may be a potential drug target for treating loss of appetite, and possibly support weight loss for those with metabolic disorders.
"IL-18 regulates feeding by locking directly into the neuronal circuitry," Conti said.
