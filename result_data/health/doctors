To reduce the work stress, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has proposed that in all medical institutions, collection of samples, putting of cannula, and measuring of blood pressure should be done by the staff nurses.
Presently, in public hospitals, these things are done by resident doctors.
The association sent the proposal to the medical education minister on Monday saying this will reduce resident doctors' workload.
"This would greatly benefit all aspects of the health machinery by giving the doctors time to focus on patient diagnosis, treatment, counselling and some much needed rest," said Dr Sagar Mundada, president, Central MARD.
He added that this system has already been implemented by the Delhi government.
"We insist that the government of Maharashtra implements it by May 31.
It should do it at once as no additional financial burden is involved and it is a win-win situation for everybody," said Mundada.
He added that if resident doctors get more time, it will give them more time to counsel the patient, an aspect which is very less in today's government hospital set-up.
"Patients would trust their doctors.
This will reduce the incidents of assault.
If doctors get more time to rest, they won't fall prey to illness.
The irritability level in doctors will be less, leading to healthy doctor-patient relationship, better quality of treatment, which will again encourage people who can afford to come to government hospitals."
