"I am sure you (Modi) would get it inquired and take action immediately.
After all, you had promised 'na khaunga na khane dunga'," he said.
NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh has written to Prime MinisterNarendra Modi , drawing his attention to alleged graft in the health department of the Madhya Pradesh government and demanding action against those responsible for the "chaos".
Singh, in a letter to Modi, sought a probe into the cases of alleged corruption in the state health department and purchase of "spurious drugs" and "poor quality" medical equipment and action against the "committers of chaos".
"I am sure you (Modi) would get it inquired and take action immediately.
After all, you had promised 'na khaunga na khane dunga' (will neither engage in graft nor will let anybody else do it).
You didn't take any action in Vyapam scam despite our representation to you.
We would await your response in this case," Singh said in the letter.
Corruption in the health department of the state is deep rooted.
Ill-equipped and mismanaged hospitals, use of spurious and sub-standard drugs sans essential tests, leniency in tender conditions to favour pet supplier companies, flagrant violation of WHO guidelines are some of the "open wounds" on the body of system, he said.
The "indifference" of the department concerned to the call of the hour points towards a nexus between the top officials and supplier companies, he alleged.
