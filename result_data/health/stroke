But higher rates reported for younger adults, blacks

WEDNESDAY, May 11, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- While Americans suffered fewer strokes overall from 2000 to 2010, stroke rates climbed substantially among younger adults and blacks, a new study found.
Hospitalizations for strokes caused by artery blockages dropped 18.4 percent overall during the decade, with greater decreases among the elderly, University of Southern California researchers found.
Within the overall decrease, however, some groups saw an increase in hospitalizations as the burden of stroke shifted to younger adults.
For example, although stroke hospitalizations dropped 50 percent for people 65 and older, they increased nearly 49 percent among 25- to 64 year-olds.
Stroke hospitalizations also varied by race -- up almost 14 percent among blacks.
Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital, in Manhasset, N.Y., said, "There are things we can do to help prevent strokes."
Topping the list: living a healthier lifestyle, which can prevent as many as 80 percent of strokes, said Wright, who was not involved with the study.
Exactly why strokes are up among younger adults isn't clear, but more awareness of stroke symptoms is the most likely reason, Wright said.
"People are more aware of the risk factors for stroke and seek help when something happens, as opposed to saying, 'I'm getting a little numbness and tingling and weakness, but it will go away,' " he said.
"So people are more likely to get help sooner."
Wright believes the higher stroke rate among blacks is largely due to lack of access to care.
He also cited a need for more stroke education targeted to this population.
Dr. Amytis Towfighi, senior researcher on the study, emphasized the protective role of lifestyle behaviors in stroke prevention .
"The majority of cardiovascular events including heart attacks and stroke can be prevented through changing seven modifiable risk factors, namely: smoking , obesity , physical inactivity, poor diet, cholesterol , blood pressure and blood sugar ," she said.
