FRIDAY, April 29, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- The first known Zika virus -linked death in Puerto Rico was announced Friday by officials of the U.S. territory.
A 70-year-old man with Zika died in February from severe thrombocytopenia , which causes a low blood platelet count that can lead to internal bleeding.
The death was announced by Puerto Rico's health secretary, Ana Rius.
So far, Puerto Rico has had more than 600 Zika cases, including 73 involving pregnant women.
All 14 women who have given birth so far have had healthy babies, the Associated Press reported.
Zika can cause severe birth defects .
Sixteen of the Zika patients in Puerto Rico have been hospitalized and four are believed to have developed temporary paralysis due to the mosquito -borne virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC is urging all residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico to continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites , take precautions to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of the virus, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever .
While the Zika virus poses little health risk to most people, it poses a significant threat to pregnant women because it can cause a birth defect called microcephaly , which results in babies born with abnormally small heads and brains.
To control the threat posed by Zika, officials in Puerto Rico are pursuing "vector control activities" that include indoor and outdoor spraying of insecticides and reducing mosquito breeding grounds, especially around pregnant women's homes, the CDC said.
As of April 27, there were 1,025 confirmed cases of Zika in U.S. states and territories, according to the CDC.
Nearly all of these infections were acquired by people who had traveled outside the United States.
As mosquito season approaches, U.S. health experts expect to see more infections in Gulf Coast states such as Florida and Texas, as well as Hawaii.
Meanwhile, new research suggests the Zika virus was circulating in Haiti months before the first cases in Brazil -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- were reported last spring.
