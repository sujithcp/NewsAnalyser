The event has generated a lot of buzz amongst youngsters.
Bengaluru is a cosmopolitan city where you'll find people from all states of India.
The city is now gearing up to join the Global Marijuana March which is held on the first Saturday of every year around the world.
The Million Marijuana March is scheduled to be held on May 7 from Freedom Park to M.G.
Road in Bengaluru.
It has been organised by The Hippie Culture, India, and is being referred to as “a collective community effort to legalise the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and other uses.” The organisers have reportedly stated, "It is time to educate our people to scratch off the taboo and use a wonderful plant for our own and the planet’s growth.”
Many youngsters have signed up for it already and their page on social media has been buzzing with comments.
The organisers have stated on their page, "People just need common sense to understand that marijuana is not only for smoking.
Can be used in medical, industrial, hospitality, food, etc, sectors."
One of the organisers has told the Deccan Chronicle , "We have already received confirmation from 1, 500 participants and we expect more.” The Hippie Culture is in the process of getting the required paperwork from the BBMP and the local police for the march.
Quoting Article 19 of the Constitution, they say that like everyone else in India they have a right to freedom of speech and expression.
They reportedly said, "Everyone has the right to assemble peacefully and without arms.
So there should be no legal issues in organising this march."
