Raipur, May 5: A picture of young Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer has gone viral on social media in which he is seen standing in an arrogant manner while meeting patients in a government hospital.
The IAS officer is facing online flak after a picture showing him standing and talking to a sick child’s mother with his left foot resting on the steel rail of a hospital bed.
After the image went viral, netizens rechristened the IAS as “India’s Arrogant Service”.
Dr Jagdish Sonkar, a 2013 batch IAS officer in Chhattisgarh, went to visit a government hospital for a routine inspection and interacted with mothers of malnourished children being treated there.
During his visit, Sonkar, who is the sub-divisional magistrate of Ramanujganj in Balrampur district, was caught on camera standing with his left foot resting on the steel rail of a hospital bed while talking to a mother of a sick child.

As soon as Sonkar’s picture went viral on social platforms, he started receiving criticism for his uncivil manner of treating poor.
Even after facing fierce criticism, Sonkar showed no remorse for the controversy around his picture.
“My action was unintentional and avoidable,” he told The Hindustan Times.
“The picture of Jagdish Sonkar SDM in Chattisgarh inspecting CHC is shocking and it’s unacceptable,” said the Twitter handle of IAS Association.
Twitter user Kanchan Gupta shared the photo and wrote: “Meet Chhattisgarh IAS officer Dr Jagdish Sonkar.
He has a MBBS degree.
He clearly knows his place in this country.” Here’s how other Twitter users reacted to his ‘action’:
Chief Minister Raman Singh took a note of the incident and assured that he would instruct the chief secretary to teach him manners.
“He needs to learn.
There are codes of conduct for IAS/IPS and other officers to be followed in the right earnest,” said the CM.
