When Dr. Lukas Wartman began medical school at Washington University in St. Louis, he knew he wanted to study cancer and treat patients.
What he didn't know was that by his fourth year of school, he would end up battling the very disease he was studying.
Wartman was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, a cancer of the blood that is highly treatable in children, but often fatal in adults.
While previous leukemia treatments had failed, full genome sequencing of Wartman's healthy cells and cancer cells revealed that a drug normally used for kidney cancer might work .
It did.Cognitive computing systems represent advances made in various facets of information science over decades.
These systems can learn, reason and interact with people.
Unlike the computing systems we have come to know, they are not limited to what they are programmed to do, but can 'think' in the manner human beings do.
Such systems not only provide answers based on numerical data, but can throw up hypotheses and lay out recommendations.
It is a big step in the ability of cognitive computing to deal with health related issues like chronic asthma, mother-to-child transmission of HIV, cervical cancer, diabetes etc.
It facilitates healthcare on a level previously impossible as the huge but mostly unstructured health-related information (data) could not be leveraged in time for building more predictability, or better diagnosis for optimised treatment.
Better, faster diagnoses is made possible for healthcare personnel as it arms them with the most relevant and latest information; evidence - smart systems-based treatment takes the idea of healthcare to a degree previously considered impossible.
External factors such as income, dietary habits, living conditions and education levels significantly influence health conditions but assessing their role was not possible earlier.
Cognitive computing enables this, making for a more holistic treatment of individuals.
This results in transforming healthcare itself as we know it.

All medicare-related areas, from nutritionists to institutions into clinical trials, doctors, patients, hospital administrators, medical researchers, public health related organisations - each individual or entity directly or indirectly involved with medicare will find cognitive computing an infinitely valuable resource.
Take the case of oncology - cognitive computing can analyse a patient's medical data, clinical notes, reports and other patient information to select a treatment.
It identifies potential evidence-based treatment options by combining attributes from the patient's file with clinical expertise, external research and data.
This means doctors can consider the treatment options provided in taking decisions for individual patients.
Treatment options are ranked, links provided to supporting evidence for each option to aid oncologists in looking at treatment options for the patient.
In this specific instance, Watson for Oncology trawls through an impressive corpus of information, including nearly 300 medical journals, over 200 textbooks, and 12 million pages of text.
It also considers supporting evidence in the form of administration information, as well as all pertinent information for each drug.
Watson is also learning how to recognise anomalies in images: melanoma, breast cancer, a cardiovascular blockage and more.
In India, Manipal Hospitals' corporate and teaching facilities recently adopted Watson for Oncology, helping oncologists to provide cancer patients with individualized healthcare treatments.
The hospital provides cancer care for more than 200,000 individuals at its facilities each year.
Another example is of Watson partnering with Johnson & Johnson using cognitive computing to create intelligent coaching systems centered on preoperative and postoperative patient care, including joint replacement and spinal surgery.
Watson in association with Medtronic, a provider of medical technology, services, and solutions is now able to predict which diabetes patients need more help in keeping their blood sugar under control.
Using a behavioral tracking app, patients with diabetes will know three hours in advance when they might have a hyperglycemia incident.
In this manner, the healthcare industry is being revolutionised touching our lives in ways we never imagined.
