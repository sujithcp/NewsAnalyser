The Kalaburagi district administration has decided to quarantine a 10 km radius area from the borders of Humnabad taluk in Bidar district, and officials from the Animal Husbandry Department have fanned out to all the villages within the radius to screen whether there was any outbreak of the H5N1 (Avian Influenza), popularly known as bird flu.
Deputy Commissioner Vipul Bansal told The Hindu here on Tuesday that soon after reports of outbreak of H5N1 in Melkera village in Humnabad taluk, the district administration began to conduct house-to-house checking.
“We do not have any poultry farm in Kalaburagi district but only rearing of birds in houses.
So far there have been no instances of any doubtful cases of bird deaths in the villages within the vicinity of Humnabad taluk.”
He said that so far no decision has been taken to ban the sale of chicken or eggs in the district since there were no confirmed incidence of H5N1.
“But we are keeping a close vigil and would take appropriate decision later based on the developing situation”.
