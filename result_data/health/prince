The painkiller Percocet was present in Prince's body when he was found dead in an elevator at his Paisley Park estate, the Star Tribune reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the 57-year-old singer's death on April 21.
The same source stressed to the Minneapolis newspaper, however, that it's unclear whether the potent opioid caused or contributed to the legendary musician's death.
Following the new report, the Coroner's Office released a statement denying that they have released any information in regard to the investigation.
Prince's autopsy was completed on April 22, and the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office previously stated that the results of a full toxicology scan could take weeks.
"Midwest Medical Examiner's Office has not released any information regarding the Prince Rogers Nelson investigation to anyone, including law enforcement," the statement read.
"Results are pending.
This is an ongoing investigation in partnership with the Carver County Sheriff's Office.
We will have no further comment at this time."
At the time of autopsy, a source told ET that Prince did have some health issues -- he was battling the flu, which then turned into walking pneumonia.
The source added that Prince had an issue with Percocet, which he started taking in 2006 to help relieve pain in his ankle and hip .
(He eventually underwent hip replacement surgery in 2010.)
Another source told CBS News that prescription drugs were found in Prince's possession and at his home at the time of his death.
The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and US Attorney's Office have since been called in to assist the Carver County investigators with their "federal resources and expertise about prescription drug diversion" to determine the cause of Prince's death.
An addiction specialist from Mill Valley, California, claimed he had plans to meet with the "Purple Rain" singer, whom he alleges was "dealing with a grave medical emergency," the Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.
Lawyer William Mauzy told the newspaper that the singer's reps called his client, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, just one day before Prince's death in hopes of scheduling a meeting with the opioid addiction specialist.
