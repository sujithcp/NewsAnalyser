Men tend to have a structurally different skin type, texture, collagen content and thickness as compared to women.
And, though the intrinsic ageing of men is slower than that of women, due to improper skin care and lifestyle choices, they tend to age a little faster than women on the outside.
Face serums, night lotions and day creams have always been a part of a women's dresser.
A majority of men, however, will not go beyond shaving or using the face wash.
Add to this anger and anxiety triggered by stress, which release hormones such as adrenaline, norepinephrine and cortisol.
Prolonged exposure to these hormones causes a continuous negative effect on the body.
Constant worry manifests in many ways and its effects can be seen on the skin, which looks dull, dehydrated and shows signs of premature ageing.
Studies show that stress leads to the formation of oxidants in the body that cause cell damage.
This leads to the formation of wrinkles and fine lines.
Stress also affects our chromosomes.
It negatively affects the telomeres, which are present at the end of our DNA.
(Telomeres are an essential part of human cells that affect how our cells age.)
Stress causes telomeres to reduce and diminish in size faster than usual, leading to ageing.
Greying of the hair is also becoming noticeable in young men who have nerve-racking jobs.
Stress is inevitable and so are its effects.
But there are ways of dealing with them.
Lifestyle modification: Regular workout helps alleviate stress and its detrimental effects.
Also, eat healthy, cut down on alcohol and quit smoking.
Skin rejuvenating rituals: Try medicated facials with products and serums, especially made for men's skin, once a month.
Laser toning: A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser can help deal with the problem of pigmentation and blemishes.
This treatment is best suited to treat pigmentation and dull skin.
Vitamin serums: Vitamin C and E serums are available for application at night.
These penetrate the skin and repair damage.
Vitamin A serums are rich in retinol, which works on fine lines and wrinkles, and also hydrates the skin.
However, do not use any serum without asking your dermatologist.
Mesotherapy: This is a non-surgical cosmetic medicine treatment.
It involves using electroporation or dermarollers to infuse antioxidants, brightening agents and hyaluronic acid gel into the skin.
It brightens dull skin, reduces lines and ageing, and stimulates the formation of collagen.
Fillers for the eyes: Treat the tired eyes with fillers.
These fill the deep lines under the eyes and hydrate the skin.
You can also try derma rollers or collagen stimulating treatments.
