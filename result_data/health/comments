A three-and-a-half-year-old child, who was being treated for burn injuries at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), allegedly contracted HIV virus after transfusion of blood.
The boy of a daily wage earner from Kamrup district was admitted to GMC Hospital with 40 per cent burn injuries in April last year.
“The boy was discharged from the hospital in October 2015.
During his treatment, 10 to 12 operations took place and multiple blood transfusion was done from our internal blood bank,” GMCH Superintendent Babul K Bezbaruah told PTI here.
On March 29 this year, the child was again admitted for two more operations, he added.
“Before the operation, when we tested his blood on March 31, it appeared to be infected with HIV virus,” Dr. Bezbaruah said, adding the hospital did not have any information of the child for last six months till he was readmitted.
He declined to confirm if the boy contacted the virus after blood transfusion as both his parents do not suffer from the disease.
“We have formed a five-member committee to look into the incident.
Only after a thorough inquiry, we will be able to tell anything in this regard,” Dr. Bezbaruah said.
The doctors have already operated the child on April 28 for burn-related injury and one more operation is due, Dr. Bezbaruah said.
