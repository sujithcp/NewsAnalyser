While adults can get through the day without many between-meal snacks, kids can’t.
Children "can’t get all of the key nutrients they need with just breakfast, lunch and dinner," says Melissa Halas-Liang, RDN, a nutritionist based in Los Angeles.
"That’s why parents should think of snacking as a way to give their kids extra fuel for growing healthy and strong.”
But just because kids need to nosh doesn’t mean they can eat whatever and whenever they want.
“Snacking should not be a free-for-all,” Halas-Liang says.
“Create a set eating schedule, like always having a mid-morning snack and after-school snack, and stick to it.”
As for what to serve, store-bought treats -- like chips, cookies, and fruit snacks -- aren’t a good bet.
They’re full of salt and added sugar, without many nutrients that kids need.
“Snacks shouldn’t just be empty calories; they should be used to fill in the nutrition gaps in your kid’s eating,” Halas-Liang says.
So what should you do?
Pack in as much fiber as possible with fresh fruits and vegetables, and include low-fat dairy like Greek yogurt.
This kind of snack is also a good idea if you don’t want your kid to overeat in between meals.
Researchers have found that children who snacked on a mix of vegetables and cheese needed much fewer calories to feel full than those who snacked on plain old potato chips.
Worried your kids won’t try something out of the ordinary?
Pair it with one of their favorites, Halas-Liang says.
“And don’t forget that presentation is key!
Make healthy food look fun, and your kid will be excited to eat it.”
