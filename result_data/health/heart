The stapler like device for mending blood vessels using strong staples makes it possible to quickly and safely restore blood vessels and to considerably reduce the post-operative period.
"The world has no other device like it.
The main advantage is that it reliably patches up the blood vessels in no time," said Sergei Prokoshkin, a professor at pressure metal treatment department of MISiS National University of Science and Technology.
"In addition, it is very easy to quickly learn to use the stapler.
It can be used during abdominal surgery to patch up blood vessels and other hollow body organs, including aortic aneurisms or during intestinal surgery," Prokoshkin added.
A standard heart bypass surgery lasts four to five hours, with doctors having to stop the heart, and entails lengthy post-operative rehabilitation.
This new stitching instrument allows doctors to operate on the heart while it beats.
Instead of sawing the breast-bone apart, surgeons can now simply bore two holes through it and put the bypass in place.
The entire operation lasts about 60 minutes, and the patient can be discharged on the following day.
This innovative stapler uses special resilient nickel titanium (nitinol) reversible shape memory staples.
These staples are inserted inside a cartridge which is then placed inside the polymer-body stapler's distal end.
Pre-clinical tests have already been completed and this technology has also been patented in Russia and Australia.This Russian-Australian invention received an award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva held last month.
