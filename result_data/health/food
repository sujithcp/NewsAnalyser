This Is How Junk Food May Damage Your Kidneys

You may try to restrict yourself, but the junk food craving that kicks in time and again is hard to resist.
While it's alright to indulge every once in a while, daily consumption of junk food can put you at the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, trigger digestive problems and cause fatigue, weakness and depression and fluctuations in blood sugar levels .A new study has warned that a diet that relies mostly on junk food or processed food may cause long-term damage to your kidneys and trigger diabetes.
In Type 2 diabetes, the body does not produce enough insulin or does not react to it which causes an accumulation of sugar (glucose) in the blood that can have severe long-term consequences for organs, such as kidneys and can lead to diabetic kidney disease .
"The western diet has more and more processed junk food and fat and there is a well-established link between excessive consumption of this food and recent increases in the prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes," said lead study author Havovi Chichger from Anglia Ruskin University in Britain.
"In our study, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes both induce changes in glucose transport in the kidney but junk food or a diet high in fat causes changes that are very similar to those found in Type 2 diabetes," Chichger added in a paper published in the journal Experimental Physiology.
The team used animal models of diabetes and models of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance to see how insulin resistance and too much sugar or fat affect glucose transporters in the kidney.
The rats were fed junk food consisting cheese, chocolate bars, biscuits and marshmallows for eight weeks, or a rodent ate high in fat (containing 60 percent) for five weeks.
They then tested the effect of these diets on blood sugar levels and the different glucose transporters in the kidneys.
The effect of the diets on these transporters was compared with the changes also seen in rat models of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
The results revealed that certain types of glucose transporters as well as their regulatory proteins were present in a higher number in Type 2 diabetic rats.
But a high-fat diet and junk food diet caused a similar increase in those receptors.
"Finding a way to block glucose re-absorption in the kidneys could offer a potential treatment for lowering blood sugar levels," the authors stated.
Dr. Anshul Jai Bharat, a Delhi-based Nutritionist, agrees, "Junk food has too much processed sugar, so when it goes to your system it leads to hormonal imbalance and also your blood profile changes.
High consumption of these empty calories can cause obesity and diabetes - diseases that directly impact the functioning of your kidneys.
You can treat yourself to your favourite dessert or a fast food burger sometimes as long as it does not replace your daily balanced diet."
