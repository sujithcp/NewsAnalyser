Sen. Chuck Schumer wants the federal government to investigate cases of exploding electronic cigarettes.
The Democrat said Sunday that at least four New York residents have been injured within the past few weeks when electronic cigarettes suddenly exploded or burst into flames.
New federal regulations can give the Food and Drug Administration the power to investigate the incidents and require warning labels, or even product recalls, Schumer said.
The federal government announced last week it will subject e-cigs to regulations requiring manufacturers to submit products for review.
