In a breakthrough trial, scientists are exploring the possibility of putting back life into the brains of dead people.
Biotech Company Bioquark has been given ethical permission by the U.S. government to test whether some parts of the central nervous system can be revived in people who have died out of traumatic brain injuries.
A report published in The Telegraph reveals that Bioquark can involve 20 patients who have undergone traumatic brain injuries and declared dead.
Using a combination of therapies such as nerve stimulation with lasers as well as a mix of peptides and stem cells, scientists are planning to pull patients back from brain death.
In the project called ReAnima Project, the experiment has received approval from the Institutional Review Board at the National Institutes of Health in India and the US.
Patients will be recruited and in six weeks, peptides will be introduced into their spinal cords through a pump, while stem cells will be injected twice every week.
Patients who have been certified dead but kept alive with the help of life support will be in the study over a number of months.
Scientists have planned to use rain imaging equipment and MRI scans in order to identify regeneration signs, especially in the upper spinal cord, which is the brain stem's lowest region controlling heartbeat and independent breathing.
The team surmises that the brain stem cells can wipe out their history and restart life, depending on their surrounding tissue.
The team bases its hypothesis on instances from the animal kingdom, especially amphibians such as salamanders that can regrow whole limbs.
"This represents the first trial of its kind and another step towards the eventual reversal of death in our lifetime.
We just received approval for our first 20 subjects and we hope to start recruiting patients immediately from this first site," said Dr. Ira Pastor, CEO of Bioquark Inc. "To undertake such a complex initiative, we are combining biologic regenerative medicine tools with other existing medical devices typically used for stimulation of the central nervous system, in patients with other severe disorders of consciousness.
We hope to see results within the first two to three months."
