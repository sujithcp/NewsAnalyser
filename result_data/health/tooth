The number of five-year-olds suffering from tooth decay has dropped to its lowest level in almost a decade, latest figures from Public Health England show.
An estimated 166,467 five-year-olds suffer from tooth decay, compared with 177,423 in 2008.
But health experts say more steps must be taken to help youngsters look after their teeth.
They recommend limiting sugary food and drink and regular trips to the dentist.
And children should brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
In 2008, nearly a third of five-year-olds in England suffered tooth decay.
In 2015, it was a quarter.
But while there has been improvement nationally, experts say there is a great deal of regional variation.
The highest rates of tooth decay were found among children living in the North West of England, and the lowest in the South East.
