CARIBOU, Maine (AP) - The federal Department of Health and Human Services says it will give more than $4 million to six health centers in Maine for renovation and construction projects.
The centers are located in Eagle Lake, Lincoln, Waterville, Bangor, Caribou and Portland.
The federal agency says the centers will use the money to increase patient capacity and provide more primary and preventive health services to underserved populations.
The agency says the expansions will allow the health centers to provide care to about 3,500 new patients in the state.
The Portland and Eagle Lake centers will receive the largest grants at $1 million each.
