THURSDAY, April 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- The teen birth rate in the United States has reached an all-time low, driven by dramatic declines among black and Hispanic teens , according to a new government report.
Overall, the birth rate for teens aged 15 to 19 declined 41 percent between 2006 and 2014 -- dropping from 41.1 live births per 1,000 females down to 24.2, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The greatest declines occurred for Hispanic teens and black teens, where the rates fell by 51 percent and 44 percent, respectively, the CDC said.
The birth rate for white teens declined by 35 percent.
"That's really helped reduce the gap between minority teens and white teens in this country when it comes to teen birth rates," said report co-author Shanna Cox.
She is associate director for science in the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health.
Any decline in teen birth rates is good news for American society, said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician -gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.
"Teenage pregnancies have a higher rate of poor outcomes," Wu said.
"Often, these pregnancies are unintended and the mothers face various socioeconomic disadvantages.
Teenagers often do not access good prenatal care and this can have a huge impact on the pregnancies."
Cox said a "one-two punch" is responsible for the continued decline in teen birth rates.
The first "punch" is the promotion and use of effective birth control , particularly the increased use of long-acting reversible contraceptives including IUDs and implants, she said.
IUD and implant use increased from less than 1 percent of teens in 2005 to 7 percent in 2013, according to the CDC.
"These devices have a very, very low rate of failure, and they only have to be inserted once," Cox explained.
The second "punch" is that fewer teens are having sex, and are tending to delay the start of sexual activity, Cox said.
About 53 percent of teens reported in 2013 that they'd never had sex, an increase from 1991 when 46 percent said they'd never had sex, she said.
