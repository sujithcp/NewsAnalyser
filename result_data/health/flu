(SALT LAKE CITY) — In a study just published in the journal Pediatrics, researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine have discovered that pregnant women who get the flu vaccine significantly reduce the risk for their baby to get the illness.
According to the scientists, infants 6 months and younger whose mothers were vaccinated when pregnant had a 70 percent reduction in confirmed flu cases and an 80 percent reduction in flu-related hospitalizations compared with babies whose moms skipped the shot.
What’s more, the study showed that 97 percent of laboratory-confirmed flu cases occurred in infants whose mothers’ weren’t immunized.
“Babies cannot be immunized during their first six months, so they must rely on others for protection from the flu during that time,” according to Julie H. Shakib, D.O., M.S., M.P.H., the University of Utah’s assistant professor of pediatrics.
“When pregnant women get the flu vaccine there are clear benefits for their infants.”
