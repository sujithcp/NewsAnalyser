 
TNN | May 13, 2016, 07.58 AM ISTGuwahati: The e-blood banking system, an electronic database of blood donors and their medical history, will soon be operational in blood banks across the state.The system will initially be used across 27 NACO-supported blood banks of Assam and later implemented in all 67 banks in the state.
The system will record donor data, including biometric data like fingerprints, to prevent people infected with diseases like HIV from donating blood.
As the state continues to reel from a thriving blood donation racket, the importance of a modern and transparent system is being felt more than ever.
"The electronic system will be in place within a month.
Every blood bank will be connected online.
Information about blood donors, including frequency of donation, will be available online.
The system will minimize errors and prevent spread of diseases," said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, Assam State AIDS Control Society.
"The electronic system will be functioning very soon.
The system is a technical one and will need resourceful persons," said P Baruah of Assam State AIDS Control Society.
Till September 30, 2015, there were 11,122 HIV-positive people in Assam.
In the same period, 8,049 were registered on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 3,583 patients were alive on ART.
Blood transfusions in Assam are fraught with risks.
In June 2013, five persons received HIV-positive blood in Mangaldai Civil Hospital in Darrang district.
On Monday, a three-and-a-half-year-old child undergoing treatment for burn injuries at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) received HIV-positive blood.
"This system will prevent liars and dubious professional blood donors from donating.
It will also enable taking stock of existing blood supplies," said health expert NK Beria.There are three regional blood transfusion centres one each in GMCH, Assam Medical College Hospital and Silchar Medical College Hospital.According to a 2015 'fact sheet' of Assam State AIDS Control Society, the blood bank at GMCH is considered to be a 'state-of-the-art model blood bank'.Recommended By Colombia
