 
New imaging of a type of protein involved in the progression of Alzheimer's may help better predict the course of the disease than a widely used method currently in use, researchers say.
In a study published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine , scientists report that tau proteins, which develop into "tangles" in the brain due to Alzheimer's, may be a better predictor of the progression of Alzheimer's than beta amyloid protein buildup used to track the course of the disease.
While beta amyloid "remains a critical marker for early detection of Alzheimer's, tau may be more useful for tracking disease progression and, potentially, patient response to therapies," researchers wrote in the study.
Previous studies have only been able to map the progression of beta amyloid; new PET scan technology allows the mapping of both, which led to this research.
The authors noted, though, that the study was very small – researchers analyzed the brain data of only 36 healthy adults and 10 adults with mild Alzheimer's – and further research is needed to confirm the results.
But the hope is that the finding may herald new treatments that target both amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which may help slow the development of the disease.
Scientists already know that abnormal buildup of both beta amyloid peptides and tau proteins in the brain play a role in the progression of Alzheimer's, but it is still unclear exactly how this buildup leads to brain cell death.
The Alzheimer's Association says more than 5 million Americans are living with the disease.
