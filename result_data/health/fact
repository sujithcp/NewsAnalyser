​New Delhi: The kind of buzz that the words “weight loss” seem to have created, it feels as if they are literally two words searched maximum on the internet.
Furthermore, the two words seem to generate an effect of its own on those who say it or hear it and then there are those who would do absolutely anything to get rid of that extra flab.
Weight loss, however, also comes with its fair share of myths that most people blindly believe to be true.
Whether it is the amount of calories, number of meals, types of exercises, etc., the myths appear to have simply grown in number over the years.
Below, we have compiled a list of ten myths that many people trust are true, but the facts are completely the opposite.
Fact: Fat is indeed bad for you, but only bad fat.
For those who weren't aware fat is also categorized into two types – Good fat and Bad fat.
If you consume the wrong kinds of fats, it will eminently result in weight gain.
The good fats, however, if consumed when they should and in appropriate amounts, will help keep your weight in check.
Monounsaturated fats found in fish oil, olives, avocados, sunflower oil and polyunsaturated fats found in pumpkin seeds, walnuts and flax seeds are some examples of good fats.
Fact: Skipping or avoiding meals is, in fact, the worst thing you can do to yourself if you're on a mission to lose weight.
When you skip a meal, your body goes into starvation mode wherein it stores calories as fat, therefore, you aren't losing weight, but instead putting it on!
Fact: Wrong!
Banana's in fact, provide super high levels of energy, which is the fuel boost you need everyday.
Therefore, consuming multiple bananas in a day will NOT increase your body fat.
Fact: This one is especially for all the women out there, who feel that strength training will make them look like a man.
The fact, however, remains that strength training doesn't buff you up, but will tone up your body instead.
Fact: Fluctuation in the weight loss process is a common occurrence.
It's called by many dieticians and nutritionists as “hitting a plateau”.
This phase is, in reality, an essential part of any weight loss program, which will normalize in the later stages.
Fact: It all boils down to how much calories you consume.
Starches and carbohydrates are less dense in calories, gram for gram, than most other foods.
If you add starchy foods with fat (butter, sour cream), or eat plain starch in large quantities, the amount of calories automatically shoot up!
Fact: Calories mean energy and all calories have the same amount of energy content.
But, this doesn't necessarily mean that all calories have the same effect on the body.
Ideally, replacing carbohydrates and fat with protein is instrumental in boosting metabolism.
Also, calories from whole foods are much more filling than calories gained out of refined foods.
Fact: The choice of food has a direct effect on the calorie intake.
A bag of chips might have the same amount of calories as a serving of fruit, but eating chips won't make you lose fat, would it?
Fact: This is one of the worst advices ever.
Especially for those who have a serious weight issue.
Let's just keep it simple and say that if you follow this route, you will end up gaining all the weight you had lost.
Fact: Umm.. really?
Time for a reality check!
Weight loss occurs when we reduce our calorie intake.
The entire purpose of weight loss is defeated if you regain all the calories that you worked so hard to get rid of.
So there you go!
The journey to weight loss really is a simple one – just stop believing everything that comes your way.
Keep it real!
