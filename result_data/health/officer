The IAS probationer, a doctor himself, Dr Jagdish Sonkarnow, is the sub-district magistrate at Ramanujganj.
TNN | May 5, 2016, 07.53 AM IST Raipur: A photograph of an IAS officer on probation, posted in Balrampur district of Chhattisgarh, depicting him standing with one leg on a patient's bed and talking to a patient during his visit to a primary health centre (PHC), has gone viral on social media.
The IAS probationer, a doctor himself, Dr Jagdish Sonkarnow, is the sub-district magistrate at Ramanujganj.
He had gone to visit patients at the PHC when someone present at the spot clicked the unusual pose of the doctor-turned-IAS officer and circulated it on social media.
The IAS officer is seen speaking to a woman with a kid, with his leg on the bed she was sitting.After the ill-mannered pose drew criticism from various quarters, chief minister Raman Singh too expressed strong displeasure over it.
"He needs to be trained on etiquettes and protocol," he said, adding state chief secretary Vivek Dhand would be asked to issue a notice to the officer concerned.
Meanwhile, the IAS-officer-turned politician and former chief minister Ajit Jogi reacted strongly over the issue saying it is absolutely not acceptable from an officer on duty.
"Officers must behave responsibly," he added.Recommended By Colombia
