An impudent IAS officer faced ire over Twitter after his photo in hospital went viral.
In the photograph, the officer can be seen talking to a sick child’s mother with his left foot being kept on the steel railing of hospital bed.
This act can be deemed as arrogance, impudence of the officer, Dr Jagdish Sonkar, the 2013-batch IAS officer.
He is a sub-divisional magistrate of Ramanujganj in Balrampur district.
The IAS probationer is a doctor himself, he was on a visit to a primary health center(PHC) it was when someone present there clicked him in unusual pose and circulated it on social media.
Chief Minister Raman Singh also expressed his displeasure over the officer’s act.
Twitter also did not take kindly to what they considered this as ‘an insolent act’ and came up with these reactions.
