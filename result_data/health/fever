April 28, 2016 -- An ongoing yellow fever outbreak in Africa has global health and infectious diseases experts concerned.
The virus is mosquito -borne and can be deadly.
WebMD spoke with specialists about the illness and the likelihood of it arriving on our shores -- again.
What is yellow fever?
Most people with the disease will have mild symptoms and may not know they're sick, says infectious disease specialist Sunil K. Sood, MD, chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health’s Southside Hospital.
But about 15% of people with yellow fever will develop serious, life-threatening complications.
“It’s potentially a very serious illness because the liver is involved,” Sood says.
“It can be fatal.”
Those people get a high fever, bleeding, shock, and organ failure.
Their skin and the whites of the eyes become jaundiced, the yellowing that gives the disease its name.
The CDC estimates that 20% to 50% of those who reach this stage of the illness will die.
How is yellow fever diagnosed and treated?
Travelers who come home from affected countries should get medical help if they have a fever or get one shortly after returning, Sood says.
“Whenever a returning traveler has a fever, a whole list of diseases should be considered based on where they went,” he says.
“If they were in the part of Africa where there’s yellow fever, that disease should be on the list.”
Blood tests can check for the virus or for antibodies that your immune system has made to fight the virus.
If those tests say you have the illness, your doctor will figure out the next steps.
“If their symptoms are mild, they can be observed as outpatients,” Sood says.
“If it’s serious, they would be hospitalized.”
While there’s no cure for disease, it usually passes within a few days.
If it becomes serious, doctors will give you what Sood calls supportive care:
