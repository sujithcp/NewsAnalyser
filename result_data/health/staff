EMAS has about 2,700 members of staff and receives approximately 2,000 calls a day
A report into East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) has found it has "insufficient staff" to meet the needs of patients in a "timely manner".
However, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said staff were committed to providing high quality, safe care despite suffering from low morale.
The health watchdog said inspectors also saw some "outstanding practice".
Professor Sir Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said EMAS, which serves about 4.8m people, required improvement.

EMAS staff were reported to be under pressure and unable to take scheduled breaks
He said: "There was an unrelenting demand for emergency services combined with a lack of staff and resources to meet the need.
"We found that while people were cared for and treated well, there were insufficient staff and a lack of appropriate skill-mix to meet the needs of patients in a timely manner."
The trust was told it must ensure there are sufficient emergency vehicles to safely meet demand and response times must also meet the needs of patients by reaching national targets.
Staff were also reported to be under pressure and unable to take scheduled breaks.
EMAS said emergency calls had increased and handover delays at hospitals had caused it to incur the extra costs.
The service which covers Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire, has about 2,700 members of staff and receives approximately 2,000 calls a day.
