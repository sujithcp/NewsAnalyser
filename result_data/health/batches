| TNN | May 13, 2016, 06.45 AM ISTRepresentative photo.NEW DELHI: The central drug regulator has ordered withdrawal of four batches of popular painkiller Combiflam from the market after finding them to be sub-standard.
Samples of some batches of the medicine failed the disintegration tests, according to the alert issued by the office of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).
"We have acted immediately and completed the recall for two batches, while the recall process of the remaining two batches is going on," said a spokesperson of Sanofi India, manufacturer of the medicine.
According to DCGI GN Singh, the withdrawal is a Class III recall wherein consumption of the product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.
However, the batches for which withdrawal has been ordered were substantially poor in quality and therefore, the regulator has taken action against it in public interest, he said.Sanofi spokesperson said the company has analysed the issue and taken appropriate remedial steps to ensure that the tablets disintegrate within the specified time-lines.
"Doctors and patients can be assured that there is no impact on the safety and efficacy of the product," he said.
It maintained that the recall is not expected to affect Combiflam sales.Recommended By Colombia
