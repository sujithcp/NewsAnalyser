Looks like Alicia Vikander is following in Angelina Jolie's footsteps!
The Danish Girl star will take over as Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot, Warner Bros. Pictures confirms to ET.
The studio also confirms that production and filming is "on the fast track" for the project, which will be directed by Norwegian filmmaker Roar Uthaug.
The Jolie-led Tomb Raider movies premiered in 2001 and 2003, earning over $400 million together.
Additionally, Variety reports that while Vikander was the studioâ€™s first choice, other actresses, including Star Wars: The Force Awakens star Daisy Ridley, were considered for the role.
Meanwhile, this is not the first time the Oscar-winning actress has (more or less) stepped into a well-known role!
Vikander was quite literally the Belle of the ball at this past year's Academy Awards when her gorgeous gown gave us all serious Beauty and the Beast vibes.
And she agrees!
"I think if you would've asked 5-year-old Alicia what her biggest dream was, it was probably to be Belle in Beauty and the Beast ," the 27-year-old actress told ET after the ceremony in February.
