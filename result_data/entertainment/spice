Victoria Beckham might have to be rebranded as Shady Spice.
The artist previously known as Posh Spice opened up about her Spice Girls days during the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in London on Thursday, revealing her mic wasn't always on during concerts.
"They used to turn it off and just let the others sing," Beckham recalled.
"I got the last laugh and now my mic is well and truly on, finally."

It wasn't just singing that separated Beckham from her bandmates -- Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Mel B (Scary Spice), Mel C (Sporty Spice) and Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) -- as she says she was "always much more reserved than the other girls" during their infamous dance routines.
"When all the other girls were being fun and spontaneous and jumping on tables, I was always the one checking the table wasn't going to collapse," she said.
"I was always the sensible one.
Luckily, because I used to wear heels, I just used to jig about a bit and I got away with it."
The 42-year-old designer also opened up about being the "one that loved fashion" in the girl group and spilled the tea on one of her most iconic looks.
"The girls always used to get their clothes for free because they were crap, and so there was a lot of budget for me to have my little Gucci dress," she explained, echoing an infamous line from the Spice World movie.
Perhaps that last comment is why Mel B recently said Beckham is "just a little bit of a b*tch to people"?
