Producers say the actress will get "the rest and support she needs" during a four-week break from the London musical.
An understudy will step in to play Sheridan Smith's leading role in Funny Girl after the actress was signed off for up to four weeks because of "stress and exhaustion".
Natasha Barnes has stood in for the star for three performances already this week and will continue to play Fanny Brice in the coming weeks.
In a statement, the producers of the show said: "Sheridan Smith will be taking a leave of absence from Funny Girl due to stress and exhaustion.
"The entire team at Funny Girl is thinking of Sheridan, and know she is getting the rest and support she needs during this difficult and stressful time."
The statement continued: "We will all miss her enormously and send her our love and best wishes - and we are looking forward to her return to the show in due course."
Smith first missed a performance on Monday, the night after the BAFTA TV awards.
She had dismissed suggestions in the media that she had not taken well her failure to secure the best actress award for her role as a cancer blogger in The C Word.
She hit out at the press on Twitter: "When will u stop bullying?
I had the best night in memory of my girl @LisaLynch."
The Mrs Biggs star tweeted an apparent reference to her absence on Monday: "Well done press!
U let down me, the cast & everyone who spent money to see me.
I apologise.
Profusely!"
The tweet continued: "Sorry!
Sorry I'm not strong enough."
The Savoy theatre said Smith was "indisposed".
On Tuesday, it was announced that Barnes would play Fanny Brice due to Smith's "indisposition".
The theatre repeated the same announcement on Wednesday afternoon.
Smith has not tweeted since 10 May when she apologised again to her fans.
"I love you who have my back, beyond belief.
Sorry x."
