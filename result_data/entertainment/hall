"I'm more amused than I've ever dreamed a person could be and look forward very much to how hilarious it will be watching him trying to prove me wrong," she wrote to Entertainment Weekly before posting on her Facebook page .
"I'm also very happy to notice that the DEA has taken me seriously enough to be thoroughly questioning all of Prince 's friends and aides from the last thirty years as to his history of hard drug use and where he obtained his drugs.
I do not like drugs killing musicians.
And I do not like Arsenio Hall."
The lawsuit came on the heels of Sinead posting a lengthy message on Facebook, where she accused Arsenio of supplying Prince with drugs and of "spiking" her "years ago" at his Coming to America co-star Eddie Murphy 's home.
"Desperate, attention-seeker Sinéad O'Connor has maliciously published outlandish defamatory lies about comedian Arsenio Hall," the court documents state.
"The malicious statements made by O'Connor are absolutely false and O'Connor's heinous accusations that Hall engaged in this criminal conduct are despicable, fabricated lies."
Arsenio's lawsuit also states that he had "only minimal contact with O'Conner," most recently 25 years ago, and that since she posted "her malicious and reckless lies" about him on Facebook, they "have spread like wildfire across the media through the United States and the world, causing substantial harm to Hall's reputation."
The court docs also claim O'Connor's "lies" expose Hall to "hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy" and/or cause him to be "shunned or avoided" and "have a tendency" to "injure" him in his occupation.
