It looks like it's safe to say the Saturday Night Live cast will have Drake's back during the show this weekend.
For the GRAMMY winner's latest act of altruism, he surprised the SNL cast with a gourmet dinner courtesy of celebrity chef Bobby Flay, which a source tells ET included a chicken dish and tiramisu for dessert.
"Drake gave us a Bobby Flay dinner and this is the best day of all of our lives," Cecily Strong wrote alongside an Instagram picture of the tasty spread on Wednesday.
A source tells ET that Drake mingled and took pictures with the staff at 30 Rockefeller this week as the show's host and musical guest.
"Drake has really been so much fun on set," the source says.
"Everyone here loves having him around.
Saturday will be a great show!
He's a great artist and performer."
In addition to the food, Drake also bought bottles of Dom Perignon as a special thank you to everyone at the NBC sketch show after Wednesday night's rehearsal.
Saturday will mark Drake's second time playing double duty as both host and musical guest on SNL .
Earlier this week, promos were released where things got hilariously awkward between the 29-year-old Toronto native and Leslie Jones.
