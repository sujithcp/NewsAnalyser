Lisa Rinna has finally changed up her signature 'do.
The 52-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star debuted her new look on Watch What Happens Live!
, sporting noticeably darker locks and ditching her famous bangs.
"I mean, I wanted to try something new, and you know, I've had the same hairdo," she told host Andy Cohen, also acknowledging that criticism about her hair bothers her.
"For 20 years I've had the same hairdo and I thought, 'Why not?,â€™ you know?"

"I like my hairdo though," she added.
I really do."
Rinna said she actually dyed her hair herself, and was inspired by this year's Met Gala theme, "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology."
"[It's] just styled differently," she explained about the cut.
"I darkened it a little bit.
I went to the drugstore last night, and I got this fanciful -- I don't know what it is."
"It'll wash out," she continued.
"Because my highlights were all crazy all over the place and I thought, I'll just darken it a little bit.
I had a vision.
It was sort of, like, for the Met Ball, the 'Manus Machina' look for the Met Ball."
ET recently chatted with Rinna's RHOBH cast-mate, Lisa Vanderpump, who dished about all the drama between herself and Rinna during the latest season.
"It was just such an awful season.
I felt like I was under attack," Vanderpump told ET exclusively.
"She [Rinna] might as well have hit me with a baseball bat on the head."
