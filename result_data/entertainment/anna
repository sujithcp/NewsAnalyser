Larry won custody of Dannielynn in 2007 after a paternity battle following Smith's death.
ET spoke with him last year about Dannielynn.
"I look at her and she's my everything," Larry said of his little girl.
"When I see how big she's become, I'm just so proud of her... She reminds me so much of her mom and as she gets older, and as her features are changing, it's just like having a little miniature Anna Nicole running around in so many ways."
