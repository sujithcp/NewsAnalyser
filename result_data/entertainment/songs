The Rolling Stones have gotten no satisfaction from presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump using their songs at his campaign rallies.
In a statement released Wednesday, the rock legends attempted to keep their songs under their collective thumb, saying that they have not given permission to the Trump campaign to use their songs and "have requested that they cease all use immediately."
Trump, an avid music fan, has featured Stones songs at his rallies for months as part of a diverse soundtrack that includes Elton John, opera, and classic rock.
The band's 1969 standard "You Can't Always Get What You Want" was a popular song for his events, and during an event on Tuesday night, the campaign played "Start Me Up."
A Trump campaign spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment or say whether they had a license to play their songs.
The Rolling Stones are the latest act to distance themselves from the controversial real estate mogul.
Adele and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler both asked the Trump campaign to stop using their recorded songs to fire up crowds.
Neil Young also objected when Trump used "Rockin' in the Free World" during his campaign kickoff announcement last year.
In all three ases, the Trump campaign stopped using the songs.
Political campaigns don't need artists' permission to play their songs at rallies as long as the political organization or the venue has gotten what's known as a blanket license from the performing rights organizations ASCAP and BMI for all the music in the licensing group's repertoire.
But artists do have some recourse.
BMI, for example, has said it has a provision in its license agreement that allows BMI songwriters or publishers to object to the use of their songs and they have the ability to exclude those songs from the blanket license.
