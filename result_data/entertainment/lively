Baby bump?
What baby bump?
Blake Lively continued to show off her expert maternity style on Tuesday as she stepped out for the Cannes Film Festival.
The pregnant actress covered her growing bump with a stunning embroidered maxi dress.
“#Cannes2016 fashion inspo day 1: Esmerelda,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself dressed in the black and navy blue beaded Preen by Thorton Bregazzi gown.
The blonde stunner also shared a pic of herself buckling her Ferragamo heels, writing, “Putting my strap on.” Lively posed in the stilettos as only she can: on a balcony overlooking Cannes.
This isn’t the first time the fashion-forward star has kept her baby bump under wraps.
In March she wore a draped silver gown to the White House’s State Dinner and earlier this month she donned a blush-pink floral caped Burberry gown with an empire waist to the Met Gala.

The next day Lively sported a cherry red jumpsuit, showing off her baby bump on the carpet with her co-stars and director Allen.
