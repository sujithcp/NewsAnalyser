Nothing compares to Kate Hudson's singing!
The Mother's Day star took the stage at mom Goldie Hawn's annual Love In For Kids charity event in Beverly Hills, California, on Friday, and she clearly didn't hold back her vocal talents.
Hudson wowed the crowd with an amazing rendition of "Nothing Compares 2 U," the song written by Prince and made famous by Sinead O'Connor in 1990.
The 37-year-old actress posted a 50-second video on Instagram of the emotional performance, and we can't stop watching it.
The clip shows Hudson wearing a black off-the-shoulder dress, crooning the second verse of the song, "It's been so lonely without you here," while the crowd cheers her on as she continues.
This isn't the first time we've seen Hudson belt out a few notes.
In January, Hudson explained to ET that she warmed up her vocals for her role in Kung Fu Panda 3 by singing opera -- and then showed off her amazing set of pipes!
At Friday's event, Hudson star expressed to ET how happy she was to have the whole family together.
"It's great.
My mom has been doing [this] for almost 20 years," she said.
"It's been an amazing journey for her.
It's very rare that the whole family would come and support like that, to be publicly like this.
This is something that is so precious to my mom."
"We all just decided this was a really good opportunity to show our support and all the amazing work that she's doing," Hudson added, referring to her mother's MindUP program, a research-based training program focusing on social and emotional learning skills for educators and children.
"This curriculum is reaching a lot of children.
Over 600,000 children, and it just keep growing and growing.
It's amazing what she's done."
Hudson isn't just a great singer -- she can rap, too!
