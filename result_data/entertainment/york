Priyanka Chopra, who plays the lead role in an American TV show, had been shooting for it in Montreal, Canada, since it started.
But, the studio backing the show has now decided to shift the shooting location of the next season to New York, USA.
A source close to the actor says, “Priyanka has joined the big league, as her show will now be shot in New York City, starting July.
It is a known fact that shooting in New York is no small feat for any show, as it marks its popularity.
Only top-ranking shows are shot there.” In the past, immensely popular series like Friends, Sex And The City, and The Good Wife, to name a few, have been shot in the American city.
Reportedly, Priyanka has also started house hunting in New York, specifically in Manhattan.
Apparently, after renting a bungalow in Montreal, the actor now wants to purchase a house in New York.
