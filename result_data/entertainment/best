Hamilton has secured a record 16 nominations at the Tony Awards, making it the front runner to secure the coveted top prize of best new musical.
The hip-hop flavoured production tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, a US statesman who harboured an unhealthy rivalry with the country's vice president.
Before now, Billy Elliot and The Producers had shared the record for the most-nominated show at the Tonys, with 15 nods apiece.
Hamilton is up against Shuffle Along, Waitress, Bright Star and School of Rock for the best new musical gong.
Meanwhile, The Humans, The Father, King Charles III and Eclipsed are in the running to be crowned best play at the ceremony on 12 June.

Three of the actors in Hamilton - Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr and Philippa Soo - have also secured nominations for best performance in a leading role, with four other stars recognised for their supporting roles.
Other nominations for Hamilton include best scenic design, best costume design, best lighting design and best choreography.
The musical has enjoyed massive popularity in the US - sparking a ticket-buying frenzy on Broadway.
Not only has it been mentioned on the likes of Saturday Night Live and Inside Amy Schumer, but it has received glowing endorsements from presidential candidates.

Other notable names who are in the running for a Tony Award include Jeff Daniels for his performance in Blackbird, and Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o for her portrayal of a woman caught up in the Liberian civil war in Eclipsed.
Overall, the nominations list did not bode well for Hollywood stars treading the boards in Broadway - with Al Pacino, Bruce Willis and Keira Knightley all missing out on recognition.
James Corden will host the ceremony at the Beacon Theatre.
