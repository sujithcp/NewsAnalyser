To be fair, would you want to watch your mom running down the beach in a tiny red swimsuit?
Pamela Anderson's 18-year-old son, model Dylan Lee (his father is Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee), opened up about his famous parents in NYLON , revealing he doesn't know much about his mom's iconic role on Baywatch .
"I've never even seen one episode," he admitted.
"One time we were in Europe somewhere, and they were still running the show.
My mom was like, 'What?
I didn't even know that they still did this.'
And I was like, 'You know what?
I've never watched it, and I'm going to keep it that way.'"

Dylan has made a name for himself in the modeling world, landing Saint Laurent's latest campaign , where he surfs and plays guitar.
So, what do Pamela and Tommy think of his new gig?
"They laugh [about it] to be honest with you," Dylan said.
"My dad, since I really like music, he likes that.
My mom's always been in the fashion-acting [world], and she thinks it's so funny that it's starting to happen to me."

As for advice he's gotten from his pinup mother on modeling, Dylan revealed, "She just says, 'Don't go out there and hustle everyone.
If it happens, it happens.'"
Perhaps Dylan will be more inclined to see his mom in Baywatch now that it's confirmed she'll return for the big-screen version starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Zac Efron.
