The couple that lip syncs together, stays together.
Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman are making their own "Carpool Karaoke."
Urban posted a super cute video of the two lip-syncing to his catchy new tune, "The Fighter," in their car on Thursday, with Kidman taking on Carrie Underwood's part.
"Oh my God, I love this song!"
the 48-year-old Aussie actress jokes, looking completely relaxed and makeup-free.
"Good, thank goodness," Urban, 48, laughs.
Nicole shows off her Oscar-winning acting skills in the video, which ends with an adorable hug between the two.
By the looks of it, Urban and Kidman are more in love than ever, even after almost a decade of marriage.
The two are celebrating their 10-year wedding anniversary this June.
Urban gushed about his wife in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning last week, referring to their marriage as "life beginning" as opposed to life changing.
"It was literally, like, 'OK, life starts,'" he sweetly said.
ET chatted with the couple at the Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas, Nevada, last month, where Kidman shared how much of a fan she is of Urban's new album, Ripcord , which contains the track, "The Fighter."
"I've been living with all the songs -- and even the songs that didn't make the album," she said.
"I've seen the work he puts into it and the love.
He's a musician, so every little tiny detail is all him, and I love that.
I love that he's passionate about his music."
