Seriously, does Jennifer Lopez ever age ?
The American Idol judge showed off her toned bod while in Miami, Florida, on Friday, where she relaxed on a beach chair in an itty bitty white bikini.
Lopez was also sporting some killer accessories, including a colorful head scarf, long gold chain necklace, mirrored sunglasses, and sarong.

Don't believe us with the whole ageless thing?
Let's not forget the sexy black cut-out swimsuit she rocked last year or the gorgeous purple two-piece she stunned in back in 2014.
The 46-year-old singer-actress works hard for her bod.
She even proved her commitment to exercise with a makeup-free selfie shared via Instagram in February.

Lo may have been relaxing in Miami, but she also dropped the music video for her new single, "Ain't Your Mama," on Friday.
In the sizzling vid, the mom-of-two is wearing -- what else?
-- a white bikini.
And vacation or not, she didn't forget to promote it either!
The coolest part?
Hillary Clinton gave Lopez a shout-out for the video.
