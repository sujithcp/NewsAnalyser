Jenni Rivera's legacy is getting a new push with the opening of Jenni’s Refuge -- a 24 hour women’s refuge named after Rivera -- and the formal announcement of plans to produce a new biopic based on the late singer’s life.
Although details are still being worked out, sources say there is an Oscar-winning writer and Oscar-winning producer attached to the project.
Rivera, the charismatic, chart-topping regional Mexican music singer, died in 2012 in a plane crash when she was 43.
At the time of her death, she was on the verge of major, mainstream celebrity, following a successful reality show on cable network Mun2 and a newly-signed deal to star on a TV series on a major English-language television network.
Since then, Rivera's album sales have soared, her memoir became a New York Times bestseller and there have been multiple rumors and published reports on the possibility of TV series and movies based on Rivera’s life.
But none have been formally announced or confirmed until now.
All official projects that bear Rivera’s name are being looked after by her estate, which is helmed by her sister Rosie Rivera, who Rivera named her trustee.
“I and the whole Rivera family, am proud to continue to build on Jenni’s legacy,” said Rosie Rivera in a statement.
“Jenni is all about living life to its fullest and giving back to the fans and the people.
We honor her memory by continuing to grow the amazing empire she built.”
Rosie Rivera heads Jenni Rivera Enterprises, which oversees Rivera’s music and fashion businesses as well as film and TV projects.
The organization’s newest project will be the launch of Jennis’ Refuge May 19 in association with New Life Beginnings.
The 35-room facility for women and children will provide 24/7 assistance and is funded by the Jenni Vive concerts playing in U.S. cities.
There are plans to open Jenni’s Refuge homes in several cities around the country.
