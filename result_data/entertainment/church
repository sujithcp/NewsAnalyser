Well, isn't that special?
Dana Carvey returned to Saturday Night Live as his iconic character Enid Strict – aka, The Church Lady – over the weekend for a special rendition of "Church Chat."
Dressed in Strict's classic purple and blue dress, Carvey, 60, dished on last week's Met Gala fashion – particularly, Madonna 's ensemble , which left her "fanny hanging out" – before turning to the current state of politics in America.
After hawking her own brand of lemonade – which is "freshly squeezed just like Jay Z's naughty parts" – the Church Lady welcomed guest "Satan," better known as GOP presidential race dropout Ted Cruz .
"Was it God's plan for you to get humiliated by an orange mannequin?"
the Church Lady asked Cruz (played by Taran Killam).
She quickly dismissed the Texas senator to the "dark side," and then welcomed the Donald himself (Darrell Hammond) – with his family in tow – to discuss his favorite parts of the Holy Book: "Always keep the sabbath huge."

But even Lucifer wasn't immune to Trump's digs: "You're the first guy that gets possessed and looks better."
Carvey was an SNL cast member from 1986-1993.
Saturday night's episode was hosted by Oscar-winner Brie Larson .
