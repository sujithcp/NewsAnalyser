Watch an exclusive clip from all-new episode of the hit BBC America series. 
 
 
Watch out, clones!
Krystal Goderitch (Tatiana Maslany) is
back.
The fierce, fabulous, blond bombshell makes her return to Orphan Black in tonight’s episode and ET
has your exclusive first look.
In the clip, Krystal is kicking some serious a** as she
fine-tunes her self-defense techniques.
She also appears to be working
through some serious aggression.
“You can be a victim,” she says, “or you can totally
get to the bottom of it, you know?”
“I’m training like I’m on a mission,” Krystal continues as
she takes down her trainer, who clearly was not ready for her intensity!
When we last caught up with Maslany, she told ET that the
clones “are all going through a lot” in the new season.
“There is some really nice character
development for the Leda clones this season,” she teased .
(For more on the show’s
main clones, read Maslany’s breakdown of Sarah, Helena, Alison and Cosima .)
As for Krystal, it looks like she’s starting to put two and
two together.
Orphan Black airs on Thursdays at 10/9c on BBC America.
