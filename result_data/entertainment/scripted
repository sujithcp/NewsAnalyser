The project, which insiders describe as 'Breaking Bad' meets 'Go,' would be the network's third scripted show if ordered to series.
E!
is getting serious about its scripted business.
The network home of Keeping Up With the Kardashians and I Am Cait is developing a new drama titled The Rush , described as Breaking Bad meets Go, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
The project, which is in development, centers on a poor but ambitious grad student in Los Angeles who finds an uncut brick of MDMA that he then sells to change his fortune.
Consequently, he becomes inescapably enveloped by the world of excess in which he's thrust.
From ITV Studios and corporate sibling Universal Cable Productions, The Rush will be executive produced by One-Two Punch Productions' Deborah Spera and Maria Grasso ( Finding Carter ).
The idea began with Ryan Tavlin ( Without a Trace ), who will pen the script.
It is Tavlin's third collaboration with Spera and Grasso.
Should the drama move forward, it would mark E!
's third original scripted entry.
The Rush would join the network's first scripted series The Royals , which has been renewed for its third season, as well as upcoming drama The Arrangement , which has drawn comparisons to the rumored saga between the Church of Scientology and Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.
In February, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group chairman Bonnie Hammer restructured her network group, consolidating all scripted programming efforts under NBCU veteran Bill McGoldrick.
As executive vp scripted content, McGoldrick now oversees scripted fare at E!, USA, Syfy and Bravo.
Tavlin, who has previously developed at ABC and Fox, is repped by ICM Partners and Grandview.
