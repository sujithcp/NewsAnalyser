Mumbai: Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman says he hasn't been personally approached by Indian Olympic Association to be the brand ambassador for the contingent going to the Rio Olympics.
There were reports that he is being considered for the position by the IOA.
"I heard it from the press but nobody (approached me).
"It was all over the press, in the google news spread.
But I didn't get any email yet.
Maybe my management knows," Rahman told reporters in Mumbai.
The composer was speaking at the trailer and music launch of the Hollywood film 'Pele'.
Recently, superstar Salman Khan was named goodwill ambassador by the Indian Olympic Association.
IOA's decision to pick Salman received a lot of flak and left the sporting fraternity divided with London Olympics bronze-medallist Yogeshwar and the legendary Milkha Singh leading the criticism.
When asked what he feels about the 'Dabangg' star's appointment, Rahman said, "I think he is a very popular face, so why not."
