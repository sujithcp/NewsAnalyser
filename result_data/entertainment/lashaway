Lena Dunham took to Instagram on Wednesday to pay tribute to one of her Girls co-stars, Nick Lashaway, who was killed in a car accident on Sunday.
“Just heard the incredibly sad news that Nick Lashaway was killed in a car accident on May 8th,” Dunham wrote on a screenshot from Lashaway’s episode of the HBO comedy.
“Nick was such a talented, funny and kind person and we were so lucky to have him as a part of the Girls family when he played Frank in episode 207.”
The 28-year-old actor played Jessa’s (Jemima Kirke) teenage step-brother, Frank, in the season two episode, whom Hannah (Dunham) meets and hooks up with when the friends pay a visit to Jessa’s estranged father.
Lashaway was reportedly involved in a three-car accident in his hometown of Framingham, Massachusetts on Sunday, and was later pronounced dead at the MetroWest Medical Center, police said Monday.
The MetroWest Daily News reported that the two other drivers involved in the accident were also injured.
The cause of the crash is still unknown and is being investigated by the Framingham Police and the Massachusetts State Police.
“We will always remember the week we shared with him, his playful smile and his easy instincts and how much he made us laugh when we had to stay up all night in the woods,” Dunham wrote of Lashaway.
“We are sending love to his family and friends and feeling such gratitude for his gifts.
RIP sweet Nick.”
