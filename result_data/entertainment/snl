Brie Larson slayed her first-ever Saturday Night Live hosting gig, pulling out all the stops (hello, Game of Thrones spoof), and even getting a little help to kick-off the show with the return of a fan-favorite character.
The Room star hosted the sketch comedy show on the eve of Mother's Day, so naturally, she had to poke a little fun at the idea of motherhood.
In one of the most-talked about skits from the night, Larson plays a pregnant woman who is celebrating her baby shower.
Her guests tell her that even though she's due on July 14, it's the first post-baby trip to the salon that truly marks the first day of motherhood.
"She wants to know when you're getting 'The Cut,' sweetie," SNL cast member Kate McKinnon says.
"You know, the haircut that all moms have," her co-star, Cecily Strong, adds.
"That's a soft waterfall in the front but knives in the back."
"The one that looks like you're going to a formal event but on the way you were struck by lightning," Vanessa Bayer further explains.
The guests then all take turns explaining their personal experiences of when they knew it was time to get the "magical" cut.
Watch the full clip below.
The "Baby Shower" skit wasn't the only highlight from Saturday's show, however.
Check out three other must-see moments from the well-received episode.

As many SNL fans can recall, the first version of this sketch was an absolute giggle fest, as host Ryan Gosling couldn't keep himself together.
