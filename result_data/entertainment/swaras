The harmony at the Midland Residency auditorium, Coimbatore, was created by siblings Anahita and Apoorva (disciples of Chitraveena Ravikiran), whose concert was featured by Amritavarshini Fine Arts recently.
Their skill in interpreting the songs selected, which the audience enjoyed, proved that they had done their home work.
Warming up with ‘Amboruhapaadame’ (Ranjani) in two speeds, they projected ‘Saraseeruhasanapriye’ (Nattai) with an easy lilt of swaras revealing their penchant for crafting appealing patterns in the sarvalaghu mode.
Apoorva’s alapanas of Bilahari (‘Vandaduvum Ponadhum’ ) with swaras and Anandabhairavi (‘Kamalamba Samrakshathu’), showed a passion that took the kutcheri to a melodic high.
Anahitha’s raga essays of Sankarabharanam (‘Swararagahasudha’) and Amritavarshini (‘Anandamritakarshini’), with a lively exchange of swaras between the duo, was absorbing and precise.
She mapped the contours of Sankarabharanam with ease, emphasised the essential moorchanas fortified by weighty prayogas and meaningful content, which revealed her potential.
‘Ashtalakshmi namosthuthe’ (Ragamalika) was a soulful version.
These young singers are destined to go places.
Shraddha Ravindran (violin) gave able support with dulcet notes in swara repartees and the solo versions of ragas were answers to the challenges thrown by the vocalists.
Praveen Kumar (mridangam) and Sunil Kumar (ganjira) brought out the grace of percussive support with a vibrant thani.
