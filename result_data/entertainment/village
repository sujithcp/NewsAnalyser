Reigning superstar of Telugu films, Mahesh Babu, adopted a village in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district and launched several development works on Sunday.
The total spending on the projects is about Rs 2.14 crore.
Mahesh adopted Burripalem, his ancestral village, under the ‘Smart Village - Smart Ward’ programme launched by the Andhra Pradesh government.
Mahesh’s recent blockbuster Srimanthudu propagated the theme ‘giving back to the society’ and it’s in this spirit that he chose to adopt Burripalem.
He also adopted a village in Mahbubnagar district of Telangana.
“My grandmother and father (yesteryear superstar Krishna) did their bit for the development of the village.
Now, I want to take it forward.
This is a great opportunity for me,” Mahesh said on the occasion.
Accompanied by his brother-in-law and Guntur MP Galla Jaydev and Tenali MLA Alapati Rajendra Prasad, Mahesh arrived in Burripalem Sunday afternoon and spent some time in his ancestral house before launching the development works.
Thousands of people thronged the village to catch a glimpse of the superstar.
Mahesh will spend over Rs 2.14 crore for the construction of an Anganwadi building, a community hall, additional classrooms in the local school, laying of water pipelines, development of roads and drains in the village, according to the MP.
“I wanted to adopt this village under the ‘Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana’, but guidelines came in the way as Burripalem is the native place of my in-laws.
So I asked Mahesh to take up the task and he readily agreed,” Jaydev said.
Burripalem would be developed into a model village, as envisioned in the SAGY, and a smart village under the Smart Andhra Pradesh programme of the state government, he said.
