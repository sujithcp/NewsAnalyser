Two of the country's most popular pop culture touchstones joined forces on Wednesday when Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and J.J. Abrams teamed up to celebrate Star Wars day - May the 4th (be with you).
Miranda and Abrams provided some special entertainment for the crowd of fans hoping to score rush tickets at the Hamilton ticket lottery, performing a live version of the song played at Maz Kanata's cantina in T he Force Awakens alongside a live band.
Miranda and Abrams stood side-by-side on the steps of the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York, where they introduced the song, "Jabba Flow," before their epic duet.
"I came to see Hamilton about a year ago, and I got to [speak] with this gentleman at intermission," Abrams, 49, recalled of his first meeting with the celebrated performer and recent Tony nominee .
"As a joke, he said, 'If you need music for the cantina, I'm your guy.'
And I said, 'You're not going to believe this, but I need music for the cantina."
Miranda, 36, revealed that the song is "actually in Huttese" -- the language of the infamous slug-monster-esque crime boss Jabba the Hutt – and might have been inspired by reggae singer Shaggy’s 2000 hit "It Wasn’t Me."
"I went to a website and they had all of the Huttese glossary of terms, and [the song] translates to, 'No lover, lover.
It wasn't me.'"
Miranda explained.
"It's literally a Shaggy intergalactic remix!"
After performing the laid-back cantina tune, Abrams and Miranda went on to announce that the song just dropped on iTunes in honor of Star Wars day.
Abrams and Hamilton weren't the only awesome celebs making Star Wars daymagical.
9-year-old Room star Jacob Tremblay also celebrated the special day with some epic Twitter tributes.
First, he shared a pic of his new puppy Rey -- named after Daisy Ridley's badass heroine from The Force Awakens -- standing next to her mini Millennium Falcon.
Tremblay also snapped a pic with Naomi Watts and hit up director Colin Trevorrow, who is set to helm Star Wars: Episode IX , to make a bid for them both to get roles in the future installment.
"@colintrevorrow For your consideration... #obiwannaomi & #jakeskywalker," Tremblay tweeted.
"Happy #StarWarsDay #MayThe4thBeWithYou!"
