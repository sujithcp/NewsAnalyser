The Oscar-winning actress is engaged to her longtime boyfriend, musician Alex Greenwald , her rep confirms to E!
News.
The Room actress said "Yes!"
to her 36-year-old beau during a March trip to Tokyo.
The 26-year-old star first acknowledged the Phantom Planet frontman publicly in 2013 during her acceptance speech at the Gotham Independent Film Awards.
"I'd like to thank my boyfriend, Alex Greenwald, for making me pasta and taking care of our puppy while I made this movie," she said in appreciation.
Three years later, she used the L-word.
"My wonderful boyfriend, Alexâ€”I love you so much," she said to him in the audience of the 2016 SAG Awards.
The moment came full circle less than a month later at the 2016 Academy Awards, where Larson called him her "real partner" after thanking her on-screen Room sidekick, Jacob Tremblay .
"I love you the whole thing," she gushed about her man at the podium.

It also looks like Larson has already unveiled her engagement sparkler to the world.
Saturday night, she took the SNL stage as a first-time host, sporting a diamond ring on her left hand.
With her first Oscar, SAG Award and Golden Globe wins and now an engagement, 2016 is certainly shaping up to be Larson's best year yet.
We just have one question: will Tremblay be the pair's ring bearer?
We'll just have to wait and see.
Congratulations to the happy couple!
