First Lady Michelle Obama dropped by The Voice on Monday, and the coaches and contestants couldn't have been more excited about her visit.
"We need some strong female energy!
Let's soak it all in!"
Christina Aguilera told ET's Sophie Schillaci before the show kicked off.
"It's rare we get that around here."
Obama, who was joined by Dr. Jill Biden , appeared on the NBC singing competition show to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Joining Forces initiative.
As part of the festivities, the audience was made up of active duty and retired military service members and families.
Obama and Biden were joined on stage by Aguilera and the other Voice coaches, Blake Shelton, Pharrell Williams and Adam Levine.
And, while Shelton's three co-coaches weren't able to recall the name of a single one of his songs, it seems Obama and Biden are big-time Shelton fans.
Shelton, who revealed that he dressed up for the "impressive" occasion, said he was "a little bit nervous" about the first lady's visit, because he knows "it adds another element of pressure" to his team's performances.
"It has to go through your mind.
You're not just looking at the normal fans that love everything you do, it's like, 'Woah!'"
Shelton explained.
"I don't even want to talk to them about it, because I'm afraid it's going to start working on them a little bit."
Shelton also said that the first lady's presence led to a noticeable increase in security around the studio.
"Our normal security around here is a joke.
It's just a bunch of guys that sleep, a couple of 80-year-old men.
They're probably snoring somewhere right now," Shelton joked.
"But these secret service guys, man they make me nervous."
