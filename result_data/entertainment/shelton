Just imagine the double dates these four must go on!
After performing their duet , “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on Monday’s episode of The Voice , Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani snapped an adorable couples selfie with Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo.
Stefani shared the pic on Instagram on Wednesday, tagging her boyfriend as well as Levine and Prinsloo, and adding a kissy-face emoji.
Shelton spoke to ET's Sophie Schillaci before the couple took the stage on Monday, where he admitted that he dressed up for the occasion -- donning an uncharacteristic vest and tie -- to impress his rock star girlfriend.
In fact, he said the country-tinged track itself was an effort to win her over.
"When I originally started writing this song that we're performing tonight, I was only trying to impress Gwen that time around too," the singer revealed.
Shelton added that the song "was just kind of something for she and I to help us feel better about what we were going through," referring to the pair’s respective divorces.
