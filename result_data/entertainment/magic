ET went behind the scenes for Vivica A.
Fox's answer to Magic Mike -- Black Magic -- where Nischelle Turner literally flipped head over heels.
"Can we show this on Entertainment Tonight?"
Turner asked as a male dancer put her hands between her knees and, in one fell swoop, flipped her up on top of his shoulders.
"And that's a wrap!"
Turner said, fanning herself.
That's just one of the moves the exotic male dancers of Black Magic have perfected, and there's a lot more where that came from, according to executive producer Vivica A.
Fox.
The docuseries, set to air on Lifetime, follows the lives of predominantly African-American male exotic dancers.
Fox is no stranger to the subject matter, as she starred in the 2015 film Chocolate City , which went behind the scenes of a fictional male strip club.
She told ET the idea for the docuseries came to her after seeing Magic Mike in 2012.
"I remember back in the day going to see Magic Mike when it first came out," she said.
"There was just no diversity that was represented.
I've got everything from white chocolate to dark chocolate to caramel to butterscotch, because we know the brothers got some moves."
Fox has witnessed those moves firsthand, as she is involved in rehearsals, choreography and wardrobe, but she refuses to call the men "strippers."
"I call my guys male exotic dancers, just for respect," she explained.
"With these guys, it's an art.
The moves that they got are just unbelievable."
Black Magic will debut later this year, but if all goes according to Fox's plan, this is just the beginning.
"The main goal of the show is for us to get a residency in Las Vegas," Fox said.
"I want to see these boys' faces on a big billboard in Las Vegas."
