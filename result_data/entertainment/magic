Why does the magic ever have to end?
!
Channing Tatum announced on Wednesday that Magic Mike Live is coming to the Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in March 2017. as well as a one-year partnership with Cosmopolitan to bring behind-the-scenes content from the show that is sure to feature a lot of shirtless dudes and even more abs.
Fittingly, to make the big announcement, the 36-year-old made the announcement with the help of shirtless male models, and even some puppies for good measure.
Last February, Tatum told ET on the set of Magic Mike XXL that the meal plan to get into male stripper shape is actually a pretty grueling one, so he can totally relate to what the hunky dudes of Magic Mike Live are going to have to endure to keep fit.
"We're all killing ourselves diet wise and that's not to be sexy on stage," he explained at the time.
"That's to be sure you don't look fat.
And it's misery.
Misery loves company and we're all sort of looking at each other like, 'One more week, one more week, and then we can have carbs again.'"
