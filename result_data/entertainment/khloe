It's not a Kardashian vacation without some drama.
The famous family is in Cuba only months after a travel ban to the country was lifted, and Khloe Kardashian already caused a bit of controversy after she Instagrammed a photo of herself posing in front of a wall reading "Fidel," appearing to reference Cuba's former dictator, Fidel Castro.

Not surprisingly, plenty of people took issue with the post.
"As a Cuban American, I am appalled that you're standing beneath the name of one of the cruelest and most hated dictators to human mankind.
This is inconsiderate and disrespectful," one user wrote.
"What an insult.
It's disrespectful to all the people who are living in the U.S. because of that name you are proudly standing beneath," another user commented.
"Culture appreciation is one thing, lauding a murderous dictator is another."
Of course, Khloe also had her fair share of defenders.
"Don't think she meant anything negative by it," one user wrote.
"Khloe is probably the most down to earth, caring person out of all of the Kardashians."
While the 31-year-old reality star hasn't addressed the negative reaction directly, she later wrote about how the trip has led her to "appreciate another's culture."
"With everyday, my goal is to expand my mind," Khloe wrote on Instagram.
"Now, it has been filled with new memories and knowledge of culture, food, traditions, daily life....
It will never go back to yesterday's dimensions!
I'm so blessed to be able to appreciate another's culture.
God is GREAT!
Thank you for my opportunities."
The Kardashian clan is rumored to be filming scenes in Cuba for the upcoming 13th season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians .
Khloe and her older sisters, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, as well as her best friend, Malika Haqq, definitely look to be enjoying themselves in Havana, where they took a group selfie puffing on cigars.
Meanwhile, the drama is only heating up on this season of their long-running reality series.
In a sneak peek released on Wednesday, Caitlyn Jenner revealed that she hit a rough patch with Khloe .
Khloe has been open in the past about having issues with Caitlyn since her transition.
"She hasn't been talking to me lately," Caitlyn explained to Kim, confirming the two had gotten into a feud.
"Khloe and Caitlyn are kind of on the outs," Kim later told the cameras in a solo interview.
