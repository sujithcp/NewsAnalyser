Most women would edit photos to trim a little fat from their figure, but not Khloe Kardashian!
The 31-year-old reality TV star has hit back at haters who condemned a recent post-workout pic she Photoshopped, explaining that she was simply trying to make her thigh look bigger due to surgery that she says left her legs uneven.
"Whenever I post a picture of my legs on Instagram, everyone comments on how f**ked up my knees look.
It's because I've had reconstructive surgery, you a**holes!"
Khloe wrote on her blog .
"My right leg is an inch-and-a-half thinner than my left because my muscles deteriorated and never recovered."
"It's funny because everyone made a big stink about this Instagram photo because I Photoshopped it," she continued.
"Yes, I did Photoshop it, but I was trying to make my thinner leg look bigger to match my other leg!
All I want are big, thick thighs and I hate how skinny my legs are."

Khloe went on to explain that she underwent multiple reconstructive surgeries following a horrific car crash when she was 16 .
The collision occurred after another driver allegedly ran a stop sign, hitting the Mercedes that Khloe was driving.
The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star says she was hurled through the windshield and suffered multiple injuries including a brain injury which left her with long-term memory loss.
"My head and upper body went through the windshield and my legs were stuck under the steering wheel," she wrote.
"I still remember hitting the other car, feeling the car spinning and hitting a pole.
I was on crutches for six months and had a leg brace that went from my ankle to my upper thigh.
I had a neck brace, burns all over my body and had to take showers sitting in a chair.
Malika and Khadijah would literally help me shower."
Khloe says she has had three surgeries on her knee following the crash and now wears a knee brace while she works out.
Uneven legs aside, we're too busy looking at her killer abs !
