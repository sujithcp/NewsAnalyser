Kourtney Kardashian just wants Scott Disick to show up.
The reality star vents her frustration with her ex-boyfriend on this week's Keeping Up With the Kardashians for flaking out on Kanye West's Yeezy Season 3 fashion show and album release earlier this year.
"I don't think so, I'm not making more drama, and wanna be out of the press," 37-year-old Kourtney reads in a text as she, Caitlyn, Kylie and Kendall Jenner head to the event.
"Kim will be disappointed that Scott isn't coming to Kanye's show," she admits during a taped confessional.
"He always has a million excuses and sometimes it's like it's too overwhelming, and I get it that it's a huge day, but we're all here to support Kanye."
Despite their split last year , Kourtney and Scott have been trying to work through their troubles.
Although, for now at least, they are not back together.
Last week, Kourtney opened up about not wanting to give Scott "false hope" about their relationship.
Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!
