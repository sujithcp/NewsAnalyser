Randeep Hooda, the lead in the movie, got carried away while filming the sequence and ended up kissing Kajal.
The actress, who has always maintained the 'no kissing in movies' stance was taken aback and immediately called for a cut.
Evidently upset, she didn't say anything to Randeep and walked away.
'Do Lafzon Ki Kahani' song gets leaked online Even as the makers of Randeep Hooda-Kajal Agarwal starrer Do Lafzon Ki Kahani were deliberating over the release date of the film, the first song, Kuch toh hai, has leaked online.
The movie’s team was planning to unveil the song at an event to kick-start the promotional campaign, but now their plans have gone kaput.
Deepak walked up to her in order to placate her and deleted the shot.
After Deepak explained the significance of the scene to her, she agreed and gave it her best 'shot'.
In an interview to a daily, Deepak said that he likes going with the flow while shooting his movies.
On her part, Kajal has always stayed away from kissing scenes since she feels it will work against her career down South, where she is a big name.
