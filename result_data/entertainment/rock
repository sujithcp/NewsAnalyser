 
Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) Actor Purab Kohli, who will be seen in "Rock On 2", says the sequel is not made just for the heck of it but has a good story.
In "Rock On 2", Farhan Akhtar, Arjun Rampal, Prachi Desai, Purab Kohli will reprise their roles from the first part.
Actress Shraddha Kapoor is the new addition to the cast.
"The film (Rock On 2) is a good sequel.
Unlike most sequels in India where its just a title and a completely different film, Rock On 2 is a well-woven story of characters you knew and loved and have grown and evolved, and you see a tale from another time in their lives," Purab told PTI.
The second instalment of the musical drama film, directed by Shujaat Saudagar and produced by Farhan and Ritesh Sidhwani, is slated to release this November.
"We had great time working on this film.
Excel Entertainment (producers) worked towards getting the right quality film that has great story and talented actors," Purab said.
Besides "Rock On 2", Purab will be seen in international TV series "Sense8".
He will also be seen in a TV show directed by Nikhil Advani.
"Sense8" is an American science-fiction-drama web television series which is about a group of people around the world who are suddenly linked mentally, and must find a way to survive when they are being hunted by those who see them as a threat to the worlds order.
In Nikhils show, the former VJ-model will play the role of a Punjabi prisoner.
