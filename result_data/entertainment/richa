Bizarre things keep happening in Bollywood.
Especially sometimes, the casting process ends up shocking most of us.
For a person known to speak her mind, Richa Chadda has now made a shocking confession and we were left stunned.
In an interview with Anupama Chopra, the actress revealed that she had been offered the role of Hrithik Roshan's mother in Agneepath.
It was eventually Zarina Wahab who played the role in the Karan Malhotra directorial venture.
Richa's confession makes us think at how many actresses of her calibre are not given her due.
The actress who has wowed everyone with her stellar performances has also unmasked a different side of the industry with her honest confession.
Because like we all know, Richa is too young to play Duggu's mom.
In fact, she is even younger than Hrithik.
