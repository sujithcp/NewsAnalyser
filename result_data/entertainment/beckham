Now that their romance is official , Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham can't stop celebrating on social media .
And on Thursday, the Neighbors 2 star posted a captionless lovey-dovey photo of the duo on Instagram .
In the black and white mirror selfie, David Beckham 's 17-year-old son looks lovingly at his girlfriend as Moretz, 19, checks her phone for the perfect photo.
"He's a sweetie... he's a cutie," Moretz gushed about her boyfriend during Wednesday's appearance on the Late Late Show .
And when asked about how her four older protective brothers feel about Beckham, the actress explained, "I'm the older woman, I'm in control!"
The couple reportedly met during a SoulCycle class in summer 2014 , and romance speculations only heightened after they were spotted together at the Teen Choice Awards.
Most recently in April, one month before going public, Chloë, her mother and her brother joined the Beckham family for dinner at the Soho House in Los Angeles.
"They had a massive PDA thing going on.
Chloë was stroking Brooklyn's arm, and at one point Brooklyn had his head on Chloë's shoulder.
They definitely seemed like a couple," a source told PEOPLE .
