Will Ferrell, Catherine Keener and Michael Cera have joined Captain Dad , the next film from Chilean director Sebastian Silva, helmer of the Golden Globe-nominated The Maid .
Described as a dark twist on the family vacation comedy, Captain Dad will see Ferrell play Rich Peelman, the patriarch of a wealthy American family who decides the best way to celebrate the birthday of his wife (Keener) is with a lavish island hopping holiday in the Caribbean with their grown children and respective partners.
But the vacation steers towards disaster, thanks to Peelman's overconfidence in his own sailing ability and a looming mid-life crisis.
Cera plays one of the boyfriends of the couple's daughters.
Protagonist Pictures is shopping the film to international buyers in Cannes with UTA Independent Film Group, which packaged the movie, handling North American rights.
Anne Carey and Archer Gray ( The Diary of a Teenage Girl) will produce Captain Dad with Killer Films' Christine Vachon executive producing.
The film is set to begin shooting in September.
Ferrell is represented by UTA, Mosaic and attorneys Jackoway Tyerman Wertheimer Austen Mandelbaum Morris & Klein.
Keener is represented by Gersh.
Cera is repped by Thruline, ICM Partners and attorney Jamie Feldman.
Silva is represented by UTA and attorney Iddo Arad.
