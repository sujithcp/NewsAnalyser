Actor Pawan Kalyan will star in the yet-untitled Telugu remake of Tamil blockbuster “ Vedalam”.
“Kalyan had given his verbal consent to star in the remake a few months ago.
Director R.T Neason, who had directed Vijay-starrer Jilla, is in talks to helm the project,” a source close to Kalyan told IANS.
This project, however, will only go on the floors next year as Kalyan is gearing up to start working on a yet—untitled Telugu project with filmmaker S.J Suryah.
It is also rumoured that Kalyan’s project with Suryah is the remake of Tamil film “ Veeram”.
