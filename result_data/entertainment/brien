Production on The Maze Runner: The Death Cure has been delayed indefinitely following injuries star Dylan O'Brien sustained in a scary on-set accident in March.
"The resumption of principal photography on Maze Runner: The Death Cure has been further delayed to allow Dylan O'Brien more time to fully recover from his injuries," 20th Century Fox told ET in a statement on Friday.
"We wish Dylan a speedy recovery and look forward to restarting production as soon as possible."
"His injuries are very serious and he needs more time to recover," O'Brien's rep told ET.
The film is currently scheduled to be released on Feb. 17, 2017.
O'Brien was rushed to the hospital on March 17 after sustaining multiple injuries on set.
The 24-year-old actor -- who plays Thomas, the lead character in the franchise -- was reportedly run over by a car while filming.
Two days after the incident, the film's director, Wes Ball, took to Twitter to update fans on O'Brien's health.
"Well, it's been a whirlwind of emotions these past few days.
I've been overwhelmed with feelings of anger and sadness and guilt," Ball wrote.
"But, ultimately I find myself left with just a deep love and respect for Dylan.
He is one tough cookie," he continued.
"I'm sorry for the grief this accident has caused his friends and family as well as my wonderful cast and crew.
It's scary seeing your friend get hurt, but fortunately, Dylan is going to be just fine."
Ball concluded the note, "After a few weeks of rest and recovery he'll be back up and running to finish our adventure together."
