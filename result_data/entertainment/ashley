Lady Antebellum’s Hillary Scott was glad to be wearing a hat when the group kicked off the Kentucky Derby with a performance of the National Anthem in the rain on Saturday.
Despite the unexpected weather, the band went on to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” a cappella at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
“What a CRAZY way to sing the National Anthem!!!
A moment we will never forget @kentuckyderby!
And I've never been more thankful for a hat!
!” Scott said on Instagram, alongside a photo of the trio in their rained-on Derby attire.
