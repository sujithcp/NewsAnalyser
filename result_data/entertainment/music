Berlin DJ Sarah Farina hopes to give bass a makeover with her positively-charged music
When we think of bass, it’s always an image of dark, deep, heavy-drum driven music that comes to mind.
But DJ Sarah Farina hopes to change all that with ‘Rainbow Bass’.
Sarah, one of Berlin’s pioneers in forward-thinking and an unrestrained approach to genre-hopping, will tell you that she finds the music which she plays and loves colourful, like a rainbow.
“The styles I use in my compositions are diverse, yet they come together beautifully like the colours in a rainbow.
And the essence of my music is bass, hence I call it ‘rainbow bass’.”
The artiste will be giving Bengaluru a taste of her music at Church Street Social this weekend as the seventh artiste of Wild City’s ‘Various Artistes’ series.
In India for the first time, she says she is happy to be able to share her music here.
“I’m super excited!
I’ve never been to India before and I don’t know what to expect from my audience.
But I do hope they love what I do and it makes them happy.”
One of Berlin’s main influencers in the underground bass scene, Sarah seamlessly blends bass heavy rhythms and futuristic beats with UK garage rock and hip-hop in her rainbow bass.
Through her work, Sarah hopes to help her listeners understand that there is a whole universe of music out there and it is all connected.
“I strongly believe that music brings the world together and I want to be part of the phenomenon.
I have a lot of positive vibes that I want my audience to experience through my music.”
When asked who her musical influences are, she says that there are many artistes whose work she appreciates.
“I respect and enjoy music by labels such as Deep Medi and artistes such as Addison Groove, Timbaland and Aphex Twin.
And my friends, who are music lovers, introduce me to new music often, so I am inspired by them as well.”
Besides music, her biggest passion is collecting internet memes and gifs.
“It’s kind of a secret,” the 26-year-old giggles.
“But I have a folder filled with cat and dog videos and gifs for every occasion.
It’s great fun to share them with people!”
Catch Sarah live at Church Street Social on May 14.
