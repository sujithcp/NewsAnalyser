It looks like there's no bad blood between Kris and Blac Chyna over her big baby news.
Blac Chyna revealed last Friday that she and her new fiance , Rob Kardashian, are expecting a baby , and her soon-to-be-mother-in-law Kris Jenner is apparently "thrilled" about the upcoming addition to the family.
A source close to Rob tells ET that Kris "is thrilled about the pregnancy," despite reports that the Kardashian matriarch has bad blood with the mom-to-be.
"Rob turned his life around and itâ€™s all because of Blac Chyna," the source shared.
"She has brought him back to his old self and Rob is so excited to be a father."
While Rob and Blac Chyna's relationship has been steeped in drama , the source explained that Kris has "made amends with the entire situation" and is "so excited to have another grandchild."
This will be the 29-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star's first child and the second child for Blac Chyna.
The 28-year-old model shares a 3-year-old son, King Cairo, with rapper Tyga.
Tyga, 26, who recently split from longtime girlfriend and Rob's half-sister Kylie Jenner, has been supportive of his ex-fiancee's relationship with Rob, and even congratulated her on the big news on Instagram.
