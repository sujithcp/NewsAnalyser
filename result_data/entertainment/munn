Olivia Munn worked hard on her ninja skills to play Psylocke in the latest X-Men film and ET has the footage to prove it!
Flipping through the air, slicing cars in two and super high kicks were just some of the stunts tasked to Munn for her first time as a mutant, but she's embraced the challenges which she took on without the help of a stunt double.
"The thing I've always loved about Psylocke is she's very lethal," Munn says in a behind-the-scenes clip.
"She's an amazing fighter, and she's not afraid to get her hands dirty."
Earlier this year at the Sci-Tech Awards, Munn told ET she trained for about six or seven hours per day in preparation for the movie, including exercises in Tae Kwon Do, sword fighting and wirework.
"It was important to me that I was able to do all of the stunts because the more believable it is, the better it is for the audience -- and the only way to make it believable is for me to actually do it," she said.
The upcoming blockbuster follows the awakening of the first and most powerful mutant, the immortal Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), who recruits Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and other mutants to create a new world order.
Apocalypse's emergence leaves the X-Men as the world's only hope against the seemingly invincible nemesis' extinction level plan.
X-Men: Apocalypse , also starring Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman and Rose Byrne, opens May 27.
