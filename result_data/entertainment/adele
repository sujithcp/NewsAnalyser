Adele didn’t just allow a couple to get engaged on her stage, she offered to play a part in their future family.
The songstress, who turned 28 on Thursday, invited fans Andre Soderberg and Simon Carlsson to join her in the spotlight during her show in Denmark earlier this week.
To Adele’s happy surprise, Soderberg dropped down on one knee and asked for his boyfriend’s hand in marriage.
The “Hello” singer could barely control herself as she jumped up and down with excitement, throwing her arms around the newly engaged duo.
"Should I be your surrogate if you have children?
I'd love to have a baby with someone Swedish,” she told them (via The Mirror).
This isn’t the first time concertgoers have used the opportunity to pop the question while Adele belts out her famous love ballads.
In March, a couple got engaged in the audience while Adele sang her track, Make You Feel My Love .
Once she realized what was happening in the arena, she immediately brought them to the stage in London, England, calling it the "most beautiful thing" she ever witnessed.
Adele also kicked off her world tour in Belfast, Northern Ireland, this year by helping a man accept his girlfriend’s proposal.
She even got the crowd to start chanting "Come on, Neil!” to persuade him to say yes.
