Borat director Larry Charles and the Wilson brothers are teaming up on a broad comedy that will also co-star Martin Lawrence and Olivia Munn.
Luke Wilson will star as Howie Summers, an incompetent lawyer who, falsely accused of a bank robbery, finds himself serving a life sentence in prison.
On the advice of his cell mate Slick (Lawrence), he finds a wife on the outside and marries a seemingly sweet, demure woman.
When, shortly afterwards, Howie is exonerated, he suddenly finds himself married to a woman he barely knows.
Munn plays Holly Kelly, a local TV anchor covering Howie's case.
Owen Wilson will play Howie's court appointed lawyer Steven Stevens.
Luke Wilson co-wrote the script to the so-far untitled project with Buck Ritchey.
The film is set to begin shooting July 11.
Voltage Pictures is shopping the film to buyers in Cannes.
Best known for his work with Sacha Baron Cohen, including Borat , Br√ºno and The Dictator , Charles recently wrapped production on Army of One , a comedy starring Nicolas Cage as a civilian who sets off, on his own, to hunt down Osama bin Laden.
He has also worked extensively in television, executive producing such shows as Entourage , Curb Your Enthusiasm and FX Network's short-lived The Comedians .
Luke Wilson next appears, alongside Judy Greer and Cannes jury member Donald Sutherland, in the Jim Loach-directed dramedy The Measure of a Man .
Owen Wilson stars, together with Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig, in the upcoming heist comedy Masterminds .
Munn next appears in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse .
Voltage's busy Cannes slate also includes Status Update , starring Ross Lynch, Olivia Holt and Courtney Eaton.
