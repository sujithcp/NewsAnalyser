Actor Vidya Balan says because of her filmography and the amount of time she spends in Kolkata, people often think she is a Bengali.
The actor made her debut with the Bengali movie Bhalo Theko (2003) before being launched in Bollywood with Parineeta .
The star will be next seen in Te3n, which is again set in Kolkata.
“I don’t think there is a question of returning to Kolkata because I invariably spend half my days there.”
The actress garnered acclaim for her portrayal of Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman searching for her missing husband in Kolkata, in Kahaani .
She will be back in the city for the sequel.
“Everyone speaks to me in Bengali and I show off my Bengali whenever I can.
I know songs, rhymes and slangs.”
“When in Kolkata, I don’t miss home that much.
I am back there for Kahaani 2 now.
It feels we went there for Te3n and just stayed back.”
Directed by Ribhu Dasgupta, Te3n also features actors Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.
Bachchan plays John Biswas, a grandfather in the pursuit of justice, while Siddiqui plays Father Martin Das, whose life was changed forever by that crime that claimed the life of John’s granddaughter.
Vidya plays a cop in the movie.
“Nawaz and I were meeting in Kolkata after six years, after we shot Kahaani .
Most of my scenes are with Nawaz.”
The actor had to learn how to drive for her role and filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh, the creative producer of Te3n , was her driving instructor.
“I know how to drive but I’ve never been a confident driver.
I wanted to do it myself, so I actually drove around Kolkata.
Sujoy was my driving instructor.
That’s the only real preparation I did.” The film is scheduled to release on June 10.
