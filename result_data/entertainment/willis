Rumer Willis is calling out a photographer for Photoshopping her face in a photo to make her jaw appear smaller.
The 27-year-old posed in a car with her sisters Scout and Tallulah for an editorial shoot, but was horrified with the result.
Taking to Instagram, the daughter of actors Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, pleaded to those who may have shared the image to remove it from their social media accounts.
“Any friends of fans of mine who posted this, I would appreciate if you took it down,” Willis wrote on Tuesday.
“The photographer Photoshopped my face to make my jaw smaller and I find it really offensive for anyone to try and change the way you look so drastically.
I love the way I look and I won't support anyone who would feel a need to change the way I look to make me beautiful.
Whether or not they realize it, it is a form of bullying, which I won't stand for.”
It isn’t the first time the Dancing With the Stars winner has stood up against forms of bullying.
Last year she penned an essay for Glamour magazine, in which she shared her struggles with body image due to being attacked about her looks in the past.
Willis told ET she eventually learned to stop taking to heart the opinions of others, especially on social media.
"When I was a kid you didn't have Twitter or Instagram where as soon as you walk out of a building a photo of you is up within two minutes or a million people are commenting and saying nasty things," she said.
"I found a different confidence because I realized that you can't base your self-worth on the opinions of others."
