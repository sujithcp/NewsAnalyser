The Bury Your Gays discussion that has taken the TV industry by storm in recent weeks is getting the spotlight treatment at the upcoming ATX Television Festival.
The fifth annual event, which is set to run June 9-12 in Austin, Texas, will host a panel on the controversial TV trope, which has gained negative publicity in recent weeks with the onscreen deaths of several beloved LGBT TV characters from The 100, The Walking Dead and The Magicians, among others.
Presented by GLAAD, the panel will feature executive producers Bradley Bredeweg ( The Fosters) , Javier Grillo-Marxuach ( Lost, The 100 ), Krista Vernoff ( Shameless, Greyâ€™s Anatomy ), Carter Covington ( Faking It ), as well as GLAAD Entertainment media strategist Megan Townsend, as they take part in a larger conversation about the importance of inclusion and positive representation on television.
As part of the last round of announcements for the event, prolific producer Howard Gordon ( 24, Homeland ) will host a master class looking back on his career.
The festival also will host screenings and panels for the upcoming farewell season of USA's Royal Pains , as well as Hulu's recently renewed spiritual drama The Path .
Freeform also will present an advanced screening of freshman drama Guilt .
The sit-down "3 Rounds With Betsy Beers: a Look Inside Shondaland" will offer an in-depth conversation with the executive producer behind Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, How to Get Away With Murder and The Catch.
Executive producers Jason Katims ( The Path, Friday Night Lights, Parenthood ), Bradley Bredeweg ( The Fosters ), Jennie Snyder Urman ( Jane the Virgin ), Mike Royce ( Men of a Certain Age ) and Jack Amiel ( The Knick ) also will take part in a panel with TV Academy president and COO Maury McIntyre on "Power(ful) TV."
The group will discuss how they organically address storylines of race, religion, the foster care system, immigration, abortion, health care and other topics, with the hope and belief that their programs will spark empathy, greater understanding of the issues and constructive action.
Additionally, ATX announced Wednesday that MSNBC host and longtime The West Wing consulting producer Lawrence O'Donnell will moderate the political drama's highly anticipated reunion panel.
In addition to West Wing , ATX also will play host to reunions for the casts of Rescue Me, Ugly Betty and Friday Night Lights , as well as the writers behind The Shield and The O.C.
Other talent set for the event includes David Simon ( The Wire ), Tom Fontana ( Oz ), Beau Willimon ( House of Cards ), Noah Hawley ( Fargo ), Jerrod Carmichael ( The Carmichael Show ), Nahnatchka Khan ( Fresh Off the Boat ) and Norman Lear.
Panels are also set for UnReal , Casual , Younger , Tyrant and new shows including Preacher and Dead of Summer , among others.
