It appears that love is in the air once again for Courteney Cox and former fiance Johnny McDaid .
The couple, who called off their year-and-a-half engagement late last year, were all smiles on Tuesday while they walked the red carpet arm-in-arm at the BMI Pop Awards at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.

While this is the first time the former Friends star and the Snow Patrol musician have appeared together at a public event, it isn't the first time they've been spotted getting close since calling off their engagement .
Back in March the two sparked reconciliation rumors when they were seen shopping in Malibu together with Cox's 11-year-old daughter, Coco.
Cox's rep told ET at the time, "They really care about each other and they're spending time together."
Just last month, Cox, 51, and McDaid, 39, were seen locking lips at Heathrow Airport in London.
