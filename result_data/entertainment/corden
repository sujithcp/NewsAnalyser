Where’s President Martin Sheen when you need him?
On Wednesday night, former West Wing co-stars Allison Janney and Bradley Whitford appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden.
To commemorate their reunion, Corden aired a funny parody sketch of the hit presidential drama, which ran for seven seasons until 2006.
In the sketch, Janney plays her West Wing character C.J.

“Sir, we need to talk about the jokes for tonight’s monologue,” she said.
“Should we talk about them in your office, which is right there and extremely convenient?
“I dunno, I feel like it would be more visually compelling if we walk and talk,” Corden quips, referencing the signature format of the Aaron Sorkin drama.
As they walk through the halls going over jokes, they run into Whitford, or Josh Lyman, who is asked what he thinks about them doing a West Wing sketch on the show.
“I think you can get away with a West Wing sketch, but you’ve got to keep it short,” he said.
“Great idea, roll the titles!” Corden replied, opening the show.
Later in the evening, they cut to the former co-stars in their dressing rooms where they are passionately making out.
No matter how many times they cut away the pair can’t seem to keep their hands off each other.
“We’re just re-living the wrap party,” Whitford said.
“You get really close on those shows, you know.”
The West Wing aired from 1999 to 2006 and earned two Golden Globes and 18 Emmys – four of which were earned by Janney and one by Whitford.
