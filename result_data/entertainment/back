Game of Thrones Is Bringing Back Another Long Lost Character in Season 6
Presented By &
The Stark family is slowly reappearing, one by one.
While there's no coming back from the fatalities of the red wedding (so far), the remaining members of the Stark family seem to be back in action in season six of Game of Thrones .
Last week, we got Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) back from the dead .
Now, Rickon ( Art Parkinson ) is coming back!
"Yes, we will indeed," she said after hesitating to confirm the spoilery news.
"Oh no, I'm literally going to go off the air and someone's going to email me!"
While we don't envy the scolding Williams will probably get for spilling the secrets of one of TV's most secretive shows, we are happy to hear that little Rickon isn't lost forever.
Rickon may not have been brutally stabbed, but we haven't seen him since the red wedding episode in season three, when he and Osha ( Natalia Tena ) took off to find safety with some Stark bannermen at Last Hearth when they realized they could not accompany Bran on his journey.
Most of Westeros—including Arya and Jon— believes that he and Bran ( Isaac Hempstead-Wright ) died when Theon ( Alfie Allen ) took over Winterfell, so hopefully a happy reunion is also on its way this season, even though happy reunions are almost never a thing on this show.
For now, we're taking this news to mean that Rickon and Osha made it safely to the Last Hearth and have been eating well and having a great time for the past two seasons, oblivious to anything happening in the rest of the realm.
That seems unlikely, but on a show that sometimes feeds babies to hounds, we're going to take all the hope we can get.
Game of Thrones airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO.
