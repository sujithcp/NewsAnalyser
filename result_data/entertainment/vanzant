Dancing With the Stars romance alert!
ET has exclusively learned that there's a budding romance in the DWTS ballroom this season between contestant Paige VanZant and troupe member Alan Bersten -- and we've got all the details!
A source close to the couple tells ET that their connection is "still new" and the attraction between the 22-year-old UFC fighter and the 21-year-old professional dancer has been building all season.
"They just got to know one another during the show and rehearsal [and] they took a liking to one another," the source dishes exclusively to ET.
"They arenâ€™t really showing it off, but they are definitely interested in one another."
The twosome first became close when VanZant's usual professional partner, Mark Ballas , was injured and could not dance in the second week of the season.
Bersten stepped up to fill in for Ballas , and together, he and VanZant delivered one of the top dances of the week with their ultra-steamy salsa.
"Still in shock with how amazing @paigevanzantufc did tonight!"
Bersten gushed on Instagram after their performance along with an adorable photo.
"Thank you for sharing this beautiful moment with me."
VanZant shared her own picture-perfect Instagram, writing, "WE DID IT!!!!
@alanbersten stepped up so I can dance another day.
@markballas is healing up!!!
Hope we put on a spicy show to get your votes tonight.
Xoxoxo"
Since their dancing debut, VanZant and Bersten have been spotted looking like they're definitely more than friends at the weekly DWTS after-parties at Mixology 101 in Los Angeles.
The duo keeps the PDA to a minimum, but they're always are seen arriving and leaving the parties together with smiles on their faces.
Dancing With the Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
