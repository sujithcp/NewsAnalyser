He actually warned me not to accept Jaya Bachchan in my political field considering her inconsistent nature and habits."
| TNN | May 5, 2016, 09.15 AM ISTThe Panama Papers Leak brought forth a list of individuals who had paid Mossack Fonseca, a law firm headquartered in tax haven Panama, and bought the benefits of the secretive, lax regulatory system in which it functions to set up offshore entities in tax havens around the world.
What was surprising was when the names of Bollywood stars, Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Ajay Devgn cropped up in the same list.
However, Big B had released an official statement denying his involvement in the Panama Papers leak.
However, at a recent event, when politician Amar Singh, who was once very close to Big B, was asked to comment on the Panama Paper leaks and Bachchans involvement in them, he came up with a startling statement.
He said, "I have made public vows in Bareilly two days ago.
As far as Aishwarya (Rai Bachchan) is concerned, she has always given me utmost respect and Abhishek (Bachchan) has not uttered a single word against me.
I don't have any issue with Amitabh Bachchan.
He actually warned me not to accept Jaya Bachchan in my political field considering her inconsistent nature and habits.
But I did not adhere to his noble advice.
He also warned me that she is very inconsistent in her ways so don't expect any consistency as far as she is concerned."
He continued, "And subsequently, he sought an apology on her behalf and the matter was done and over.
Thereafter, at Anil Ambani's residence, at a dinner, a major squabble took place and that too on behalf of Jaya Bachchan and he became a party to my dispute with Mrs Bachchan...
Please go and pose this question to Arun Jaitley, the agencies which are probing Mr Bachchan or Mr Bachchan himself.
Leave me alone and let me live in peace without Bachchans and their name."
