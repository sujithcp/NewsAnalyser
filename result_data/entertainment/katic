Stana Katic makes her highly-publicized exit from Castle in next week's season finale and judging by this new promo, it's going to be a tearjerker.
In the dramatic teaser, a mystery man tells Castle (Nathan Fillion), "Kate Beckett is going to be dead by the end of the night and there is nothing you can do about it.
Everything ends in tragedy â€“ even an epic love story like yours."
Sounds like Beckett's goodbye is going to be just as climactic as Katic's real-life departure from the series.
The 37-year-old actress' shocking exit was confirmed last month amid reports that ABC was cutting her from the show.
Devastated fans revolted at the news on social media, while Katic thanked loyal viewers for their support.
"Rather than distract from what was an amazing experience I would just like to say that I'm very grateful to ABC for giving me the opportunity to be a part of a much beloved show," Katic wrote on Twitter.
"Thank you to the fans."
