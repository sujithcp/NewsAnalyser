Selma helmer Ava DuVernay has exited Intelligent Life , the sci-fi DreamWorks project that has Lupita Nyong'o attached to star.
Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow and his collaborator Derek Connolly wrote the script, which centers on a United Nations employee who monitors outer space and makes contact with a beautiful woman who may be an alien.
DuVernay joined the project in February but has left over scheduling conflicts, according to sources.
Nyong'o remains attached to star.
Steven Spielbergâ€™s Amblin Entertainment is producing the project along with Frank Marshall, Trevorrow and the production banner Big Beach.
DuVernay currently is working on the OWN series Queen Sugar , starring Rutina Wesley.
The director also is attached to Disney's adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time , the children's book classic by Madeleine L'Engle.
