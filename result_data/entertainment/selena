While the photos may appear...suspect, the two stars were not hitting the Vegas clubs together.
Selena was hosting the official after-party for her Revival tour at LIGHT at Mandalay Bay, while Orlando happened to be there for a friend's bachelor party.
At one point in the night, the Lord of the Rings actor found Selena to say hi, an eyewitness inside LIGHT nightclub tells ET.
The girlfriends Selena was with hit the dance floor, leaving Orlando and Selena in the booth alone -- that is, aside from the security surrounding her table.
"There was leg touching, hugging, talking closely, but no one saw kissing," we're told.
"They definitely did not leave together."
Romance rumors have followed Selena and Orlando for years, but another source insists they really are just friends.
"They have the same manager and are close friends.
Selena is also very friendly and touchy-feely," the source says.
"Katy and Orlando are very in love and doing great."

65?
31?
:-/" (It's worth pointing out that Perry is 31.)
"Katy and Orlando are the real deal and are totally in love.
We've never seen Katy this happy and so smitten," a source previously revealed to ET.
"They are head over heels for each other."
ET has reached out to reps for Katy, Orlando and Selena.
