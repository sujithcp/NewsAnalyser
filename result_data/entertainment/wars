We all know first lady Michelle Obama can dance , but the president has moves too!
Star Wars fans around the world celebrated Star Wars Day -- i.e. May the 4th -- on Wednesday, and the Obamas were no different.
The White House tweeted a cute video of the couple dancing to Bruno Mars' "Uptown Funk" with R2-D2, the president later calling out two stormtroopers to join in.
"Oh, this is my favorite song!"
Michelle notes.
"How did you know?"
"'Uptown Funk,' baby," Obama smiles.
The president has talked about his love for the beloved George Lucas franchise before, ending a news conference in December with, "OK everybody, I gotta get to Star Wars ."
Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shown at the White House in December for children of military families who lost family members.
