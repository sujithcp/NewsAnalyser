Jada Pinkett Smith's kids -- Jaden and Willow -- are almost all grown up!
The Bad Mom star opened up to ET about parenting at this year's Cinema-Con, and revealed that while her offspring certainly have been known for their bold choices, a lot about raising them has been pretty much what you'd expect.
"I have to stay up until 12, sweating, making sure they are getting in on their curfew," the 44-year-old actress revealed.
"That's kind of how my Friday nights are."
And with Jaden turning 18 in July, Jada can foresee a lot changing with regard to her son confiding in her.
"Listen, I only got a couple more months with them," she joked.
"In a minute, he's going to be a full-fledged adult, and be like, 'I don't have to come to you and ask you nothing!'"
Jada says that when it comes to parenting, she also learned from past experiences and struggles she and her husband of 18 years, Will Smith, have had with guardianship.
"You have to be in partnership with them, there's no more dictating," she explained.
"I did that with two -- we adopted a nephew, and I had my goddaughter -- and it just didn't go well.
It just didn't."
"It's fine now, they're adults, and they got past their difficult times," she continued.
"But I learned from them to do it a different way with Jaden and Willow."
Meanwhile, this past April, Will told ET that he believes Jaden will still look to his parents for advice, even as he enters adulthood.
“I’m pretty sure he will,” the 47-year-old actor told ET.
“We developed a pretty good relationship of trust, so I think he’ll continue to run them by.”
