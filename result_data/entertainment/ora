Rita Ora once again got people talking without saying a word.
After her lemon-themed bra and "Formation" dress led to rumors that she might be Beyonce's "Becky with the good hair," the 25-year-old singer stepped out wearing a "Not Becky" pin following Monday night's Met Gala in New York City .

Ora switched out of her Vera Wang gown and into a scantily-clad, pleather mini-dress, but all eyes were still on her accessory.
Later in the evening, the "Not Becky" pin -- which Katy Perry was also seen wearing -- was missing from her outfit, but a selfie of Ora and Beyonce showed up in the British pop star's Snapchat story.
"Family," she captioned the pic of herself smiling with the Queen Bey.

While Ora, along with Beyonce and her sister Solange Knowles , appeared to have a great time on the first Monday of May, one person was noticeably not in attendance.
Jay Z, who usually escorts his wife to the Met Gala, did not make an appearance.
Beyonce instead hit the red carpet solo, and while she had a ring on every finger, she wasn't wearing his.
The 34-year-old singer was still all smiles as she posed in her skintight, flesh-toned latex Givenchy gown.
