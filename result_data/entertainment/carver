They also are co-executive producing the drama from Drew Barrymore.
Max and Charlie Carver have set their next starring project.
The brothers are set to star in MTV drama Blooms, which they're already on board as co-executive producers.
The project, included on MTV's upfront slate , is a crime drama/coming-of-age story of twentysomething twin brothers, Andrew and Elliott Bloom, who learn of one another's existence upon the murder of their father.
In turn, they inherit a hand-crafted secret criminal empire he's left them — with many strings attached.
The immorality, corruption and debauchery of their father’s world is deep, and every time they think they’ve reached the bottom it gets worse.
The young men are inexperienced but not innocent, vastly different but in many ways exactly the same, with each missing something in his life that only the other can supply.
The Carver brothers will play Andrew and Elliott.
Walter Mosley will pen the script and executive produce the drama from Universal Cable Productions and Drew Barrymore's Flower Films.
Mosley will exec produce alongside Barrymore and her Flower partners Ember Truesdell, Nancy Juvonen and Chris Miller.
Diane Houslin also will exec produce with the Carvers, and Greg Herman is set to co-exec produce.
Blooms marks the latest onscreen role for the Carver siblings, who count Teen Wolf, The Leftovers and Desperate Housewives among their credits.
They are repped by Gersh, Authentic Talent and attorney Steve Younger.
