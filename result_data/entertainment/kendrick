Anna Kendrick makes an adorable appearance in Justin Timberlake’s new music video for “Can’t Fight the Feeling,” but that’s not the only musical project the Trolls co-stars have been teaming up on.
The pair took the stage at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, introducing themselves as “Anna and Garfunkel,” to perform an adorable cover of Cyndi Lauper’s 1986 hit, “True Colors.”
“We’re just having fun, we’re just friends here, right?” Kendrick joked with the crowd, perhaps belying some nerves to sing onstage with the former boy bander.
“We’re just like, hanging out in your living room and this isn’t a big deal.”
The pair’s emotional duet, as well as “Can’t Fight the Feeling,” will be featured on the Trolls soundtrack, which comes out in September, ahead of the film's Nov. 4 release.
Earlier in the day, Timberlake and Kendrick, who both star in Dreamworks upcoming animated film based on the popular dolls, spoke to ET about their experience traveling to Cannes to promote the movie.
"Sometimes this is a little bit crazy and it's good to have kind of a practical partner in crime, because sometimes actors can be crazy," Kendrick said.
"And musicians, even more so, even though I know fewer.
But Justin is just a practical person and a good person to have on your team when you're facing this kind of craziness."
