It was the dance seen around the world when video of Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston boogeying at the Met Gala went viral earlier this week , and now the Thor star is opening up about how the moment came about.
"I love dancing, who doesn't?"
Hiddleston told the Press Association in a recent interview.
"It's a weird one (that it went viral).
I haven't actually danced for a long time, but I happened to be dancing at the Met Gala, because it was a party.
"I was on a table with Taylor Swift and The Weeknd was playing and she said, 'The thing about these parties is nobody gets up to dance,'" he continued.
"She, as a musician, was like, 'We've got to dance for The Weeknd!'
so we got up and danced."
They didn't just dance.
They got down!
In a video posted by Valentino brand ambassador Carlos Souza on Instagram, the Tay vs. Tom dance-off involved Swift, 26, leading Hiddleston, 35, onto the dance floor during T.I.
's hit "Bring Em Out."
The GRAMMY winner then shimmied away, waving her hands in the air, while Hiddleston pulled out his best robotic moves.
Later, the pair danced away to Beyonce's "Crazy in Love," with Hiddleston gingerly twirling Swift around during the song's rousing chorus.
