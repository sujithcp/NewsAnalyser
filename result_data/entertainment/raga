As mercury soared, a cool and delectable veena recital by renowned Bhamidipati Kanaka Durga Prasad (BKD) provided respite for sangeeta rasikas at Rajiv Smruthi Bhavan on the crowded beach road in Visakhapatnam.
It was a concert that stood out for its melodic shades in its diverse dimensions.
Each of the presentations exuded a soothing feel, touching the inner recess of hearts letting the audience stay afloat in musical delight.
Every meetu and strum of strings was very soft and tender.
Every phrase generated a typical soft and flowing feel of elegant music.
Responding to graceful playing in rapt and soul forgetful mood nodding heads in appreciation, the audience enjoyed it thoroughly to the last twang.
BKD took off on a brilliant note with a varnam Ninnu Kori of Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar in raga Mohana.
With this warm up setting the tone for the session, he picked up raga Naata for Sarasiruhasana Priye of Pullyur Duraiswamy Iyer.
Then came, Nadaloludai of Thyagaraja in raga Kalyana Vasantham.
This piece brought out the quintessential shades of musical ecstasy that the composition sought to portray suggesting the superlative effect of music in leading the mind to perennial and lasting state of bliss.
His music blends melody and cadence in such a perfect proportion that it continues to cling to the memory for a long time to come.
This aspect sets his performance apart and his elaborate delineation of raga Gaanamoorthi for the composition Gaanamurthey of Thyagaraja bore an eloquent testimony to it.
The progression of raga essay from lower octave to the higher in varied tempos and from subtle to explicit in a structured way was remarkable and his measured exposition of raga exploring its melodic contours was classy in its own right.
The swara suits that tailed well with the rendition of the composition further upped its emotive claim.
Presentation of raga Hamirkalyani was another notable piece in the session that mesmerized the music lovers.
The krithi for this was Venkatasaila vihara of Subbaraya Sastry.
In its lucid yet masterly treatment, the raga meandered like a stream softly coursing through blooming dale in moonlight.
The other pieces that delighted were Sarasa Samadana in Kapinarayani, Paluke Bangaramaye of Bhadrachala Ramadoss in Anandabhairavi and Hari Hari Rama in Kanada.
Percussion support by Mandapaka Nagalakshmi on mridangam and Mavuduri Surya Prasada Rao on ghatam was a tour de force.
