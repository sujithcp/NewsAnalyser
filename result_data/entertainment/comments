The much anticipated actor Ajith Kumar’s tentatively titled Tamil outing “Thala 57” will roll from July, a source said.
“The makers of the film will officially sign the agreement with Ajith on Thursday.
The regular shooting will start from July,” a source from the film’s unit told IANS.
The film will be directed by Siva, who had previously worked with Ajith in “Veeram” and in last year’s “Vedalam”.
This will be their third project in a row, and it will feature music composer Anirudh Ravichander for the second successive time.
Sathya Jyothi Films is bankrolling this project.
