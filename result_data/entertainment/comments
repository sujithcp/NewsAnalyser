MUMBAI: The sneak peak of "Kaabil" that focuses on a burning candle and actor Hrithik Roshan's intense look, has been unveiled online.
Hrithik took to Twitter on Wednesday night to share the first look of the film.
He also wrote it: "Blinded by a million eyes watching me...when in fact I am the observer, I am the watcher.
The minds eye sees all.
#Kaabil."
Directed by Sanjay Gupta -- who has delivered hits like "Shootout at Wadala" and "Kaante" -- the film seems to be full on action and blood.
Actress Yami Gautam is set to portray a blind girl in the upcoming film, which will hit the screens on January 26, 2017.
It's been produced by Hrithik's father and filmmaker Rakesh Roshan.
