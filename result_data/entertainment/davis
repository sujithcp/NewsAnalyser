Geena Davis and the Rockford Peaches were ready to play ball this weekend.
The 60-year-old actress -- who played Dottie Hinson in the film -- reunited with the cast of the 1992 film, A League of Their Own , for a friendly game of baseball at the 2nd Annual Bentonville Film Festival Championing Women And Diverse Voices In Media, which Davis co-founded, in Bentonville, Arkansas.
Davis, along with Megan Cavanagh (Marla Hooch), Anne Ramsey (Helen Haley), Tracy Reiner (Betty 'Betty Spaghetti' Horn), Ann Cusack (Shirley Baker), Freddie Simpson (Ellen Sue Gotlander), and Patti Pelton (Marbleann Wilkenson), were suited up in their Peaches uniforms for the big game.
Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell, however, were not in attendance.
"This event was so popular last year that we decided to do it again,” she said of the reunion .
“And I’m so thrilled to have six of my Rockford Peaches cast mates attending the game this year.
Last October, Davis spoke to ET about the effect League had on female fans , and gender equality in Hollywood.
"I had teenage girls coming up to me and saying, 'I play sports because of that movie!'"
she said.
"I immediately noticed that there were a lot more male characters than female characters in what was actually being made for little kids, and I was horrified.
What message does that send?
Truly, they should be showing boys and girls sharing the sandbox equally, with girls doing half of the interesting stuff, too."
