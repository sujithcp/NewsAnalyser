Kim Kardashian has "broken the internet" more times than we can recall and now she's getting special recognition for the massive amounts of regular recognition she's already managed to garner.
The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is being honored with a Webby Award in celebration of her "unprecedented success" in using the internet and social media to establish her brand and "connect with a truly global audience," the Webby Awards said in announcing the honor Wednesday.
The 35-year-old mother of two is set to accept the brand-new Break the Internet Award at this year's 20th awards show in person.
The Webby Awards , the internet's most coveted honor when it comes to content creators, limits winners to five-word acceptance speeches.
It's going to be interesting to see what she will say with only five words.
Kardashian isn't the only member of her family who will be honored this year.
Her husband, Kanye West, is among several other honorees, including Jessica Alba, Lena Dunham, Jenni Konner and the satirical news organization The Onion .
The 20th Annual Webby Awards takes place May 16.
Fans can watch the ceremony On Demand via the Xfinity X1 platform and streaming online .
