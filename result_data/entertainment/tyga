Tyga just earned some major cool dad points.
Just hours after his ex-fiancée, Blac Chyna, revealed she is expecting a child with her new fiancé , Rob Kardashian, the 26-year-old rapper took to Instagram to share a series of sweet photos of his and Chyna's 3-year-old son, King Cairo .
Tyga, who is currently dating Rob's sister , Kylie Jenner, took his toddler on an adventurous father-son play date on Friday, and judging by the photos, he doesn't seem to be at all fazed by the shocking baby news.
In fact, the "Rack City" rapper appears quite happy as little King Cairo wraps his arms around his neck and sweetly graces the side of his face!

It doesn't get much cuter than that!
King Cairo's mama seemingly confirmed the news that she's pregnant with Rob's first child when she Instagrammed a pregnant avatar of herself and tagged the reality star over her belly.

Shortly after the model uploaded the pic, Tyga continued to show his support for the couple, commenting, "Congratulations."
Jenner followed suit, giving the photo a like.
Earlier this week, a source told ET that while Rob and Chyna's relationship was "tough for [Kylie] in the beginning," she's since gotten over it .
"She sees how happy he is and all she wants is for him to be happy," the source added.
"The general consensus in the house is 'Praise Chyna!
Don't go!'
They finally got the brother they always knew back."
