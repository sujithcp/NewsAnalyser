Jennifer Lopez shared a number of gifts with her Instagram followers on Thursday, first flaunting her figure in a steamy bikini photo , and then teasing her new music video with a stylized sneak peek.
Laying out in the spring sun, the former American Idol judge snapped a sexy selfie showing off her white bikini top and aviator sunglasses.
"Happy sunny day!!"
the 46-year-old captioned the sultry shot.
"Are you guys ready for #aintyourmama video!!??"
Four hours later, Lopez made good on her tease when she shared a sneak peek at the music video for her song "Ain't Your Mama" with a vintage-looking, sepia-toned behind-the-scenes clip.
The video, which premieres Friday on Vevo, appears to feature Lopez dressed up like a 1950s housewife , complete with a voluminous, Stepford Wives -esque 'do.
The look is remarkably more retro than the super-revealing, brightly colored ensemble she rocked while debuting "Ain't Your Mama" during the American Idol finale .
Check out the video below to relive Lopez's wild, raucous performance.
