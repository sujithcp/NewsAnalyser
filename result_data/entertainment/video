The theme of this year's Met Gala in New York City was technology, and while not all the styles seemed to align, Vogue magazine's video booth certainly did.
Instead of the photo booths that friends often shove themselves into at weddings and pose with oversized mustache props, the high-fashion magazine decided to step it up with a video element that allowed participants to make their moves to music.
The booth was reminiscent of Michael and Janet Jackson's "Scream" music video or Jamiroquai's "Virtual Insanity."
Needless to say, the celebrities loved it.
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West looked like they were making a sequel to the rapper's "Bounce 2" music video, while Kendall Jenner made the booth her runway.
Others took a more subdued approach.
Blake Lively -- who's pregnant with baby No.
2 -- turned her back to the camera to show off her elaborate Burberry gown.
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen also kept cool, only moving to stare at one another.
Meanwhile, Madonna and brother-sister duo Jaden and Willow Smith, used the booth as their dance floor.
Other stars to try out Vogue 's video component included Selena Gomez, Adriana Lima, Alicia Vikander and the magazine's editor-and-chief, Anna Wintour.
The videos were subsequently posted on Vogue 's Instagram account throughout the evening.
The annual Met Gala is many times referred to as fashion's Oscars, and this year was no different.
