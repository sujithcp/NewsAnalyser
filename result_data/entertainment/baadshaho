Here is why Baadshaho won’t clash with Raees...
Earlier this week Shah Rukh Khan starrer Raees ’ release date was moved ahead from Eid 2016 to Republic Day 2017.
Although a clash with Salman Khan’s Sultan was avoided, SRK’s film was now locking horns with two films -- Hrithik Roshan’s Kaabil and Ajay Devgn’s Baadshaho .
While Rakesh Roshan is adamant about not moving from his release date, an industry insider informs that the Badshah and Baadshaho won’t clash.
“Shah Rukh and the Excel team has planned everything nicely now.”
The source further adds, “Ajay is mostly shifting the release because Baadshaho won’t be ready in January.
The makers are now eyeing for a March 10 release.
Ajay is now shooting his directorial venture Shivaay which he will wrap by June.
He begins shooting for Baadshaho in July end- early August.
His film with Remo D’Souza co-starring Sooraj Pancholi too goes on floors this September.
So he will be juggling between the two films and it is highly improbable that Ajay’s Baadshaho will be ready in time for a January release.
That’s why they have taken a call to shift the release date.”
Baadshaho will now hit screens in March along with Dharma’s recently announced sequel Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya starring Alia and Varun.
Another source tells us, “It will be Ajay versus Dharma back to back this Diwali and next March.” This year KJo’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Devgn’s Shivaay will hit the screens on the same Friday in Diwali week.
