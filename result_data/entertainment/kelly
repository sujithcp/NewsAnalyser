New love or fun friends?
Kelly Osbourne shared a cute throwback picture of herself with country singer Dustin Lynch late Tuesday night, calling the musician her “boyfriend” on Instagram.
“I really miss my boyfriend @dustinlynchmusic #ImCountryNow,” she captioned the shot from the music festival.
Just last week Osbourne attended the annual event, and shared another photo with Lynch, writing, “Thank you @dustinlynchmusic & everyone on your team for treating me like family!
#stagecoach.”
A source close to the pals tells ET, “Kelly and Dustin didn't hook up a Stage Coach, but she is a big fan and they hit it off as fast friends.”
In addition to the dating rumors, Kelly also has plenty of personal drama in her life right now.
Her parents, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, have split after 33 years of marriage following Ozzy’s alleged affair with a hair stylist.
On Tuesday, Kelly posted a photo of herself holding up a lemon writing, “Guess who’s turning [lemons] into #lemonade?” seemingly referencing Beyonce’s new visual album, Lemonade .
Sharon also gave a nod to the singer’s record about her husband’s alleged infidelity, bringing a large glass of lemonade onto her show The Talk on Tuesday.
