Audra McDonald is taking a break from Broadway for a baby!
The 45-year-old Shuffle Along star announced on Tuesday that she is expecting.
“Who knew that tap dancing during perimenopause could lead 2 pregnancy?” she tweeted , adding that she and her husband, Will Swenson, are “surprised but elated” for their new addition.
McDonald is already a mom to a daughter from a previous marriage and Swenson has two sons from a prior union.
The couple tied the knot in 2012 and this will be their first child together.
McDonald is set to go on maternity leave from Shuffle Along on July 24 and her West End debut in Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill has been postponed, according to Broadway.com.
“I am so very grateful to everyone in New York and London for allowing me to rearrange my schedule to accommodate this little miracle,” the six-time Tony winner continued in a statement to the site.
“While I’m disappointed I have to postpone my West End debut in Lady Day, I’m glad I’ll be able to spend a little more time in Shuffle Along this summer and will look forward to setting up a 1920s-themed nursery in my dressing room when I return to the show.”
McDonald’s “perimenopause” pregnancy announcement follows ET’s exclusive news that the 49-year-old singer Janet Jackson is expecting her first baby.
