US comedian Arsenio Hall has filed a $5m (£3.5m) lawsuit against Sinead O'Connor after the Irish singer accused him of supplying drugs to Prince.
O’Connor, whose best-known song Nothing Compares 2 U was written by the late musician, made the allegations in a Facebook post.
She said she had reported Hall to investigators, adding that he should "expect their call".
Hall, who is best known for his late night talk show in the late 1980s and early 90s, has described the accusations as "despicable, fabricated lies".
The lawsuit, filed in LA on Thursday, states: "Desperate, attention seeker Sinead O'Connor has maliciously published outlandish defamatory lies about comedian Arsenio Hall, falsely accusing him of supplying illegal 'hard drugs' 'over the decades' to the recently deceased music artist, Prince, and of spiking her with drugs once years ago."
Hall has asked for a jury trial, estimating the damage to his reputation to be worth "not less than" $5m.
It is not the first time O'Connor has courted controversy through comments on her website and social media.
