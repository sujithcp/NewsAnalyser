The 'Force Awakens' star chats with ET about Poe Dameron's big and unexpected return.
The Star Wars universe is back in full effect.
ET's Carly Steel caught up with The Force Awakens star Oscar Isaac, who's about to appear in another big budget film -- X-Men: Apocalypse' , out May 27 -- and the actor told us that when it comes to fighting for the rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, he's just happy to be "around."
When asked about how his character [MINOR SPOILERS] living to see another day in Episode VII (Poe Dameron reportedly was initially going to die in the film) will affect the followup chapter, 37-year-old Isaac responded, "Well, I'm around, first of all, which is nice."
"The new additions to the cast, like Laura Dern and Benicio Del Toro, they're incredible actors and Rian [Johnson, Episode VIII's director], his sensibility is one of smaller films," the Golden Globe winner explained.
"So, within all of the bigness and the epic scope of the film, it does feel like we're getting to find some of that nuance and that intimacy."
Additionally, Isaac revealed his character will get in on a lot more of the action, which is set to push the characters to their limits, when the movie hits theaters in December 2017.
"Poe, he gets to be more a part of the story, and all of the characters in the film, they get tested, intensely," he said.
"It's a lot of conflict in it, which is great."
