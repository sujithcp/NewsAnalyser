Beyonce and Jay Z were spotted having an affectionate night out with their daughter, 4-year-old Blue Ivy, on Thursday night -- more evidence that the two are just fine, even after Beyonce's Lemonade dropped last month with themes of infidelity .
The family ate dinner at Mamo restaurant in New York City, and a source tells ET that the couple looked "lovey-dovey and happy."
The two even held hands as they walked in and out of the Italian eatery.
"They looked really happy to be out all together," the source says of their meal, which lasted for a couple of hours.
The A-list pair also had a friendly chat with actor Adrien Brody, who was sitting at a nearby table and approached them to say hello, our source adds.
Brody and the "Formation" singer co-starred together in 2008's Cadillac Records .
Last week, a source close to the couple exclusively told ET that Bey, 34, and Jay, 46, are currently doing "better than ever," despite all the "Becky with the good hair" drama , and Beyonce showing up to the Met Gala solo and not wearing her wedding ring.
"Beyonc√© and Jay Z are totally fine," the source said.
"Their relationship is great and doing better than ever.
They're good."
"Jay Z didn't go to the Gala because he didn't really need to," the source also explained.
"He doesn't have anything going on right now, and let's be honest, him not going all drums up excitement for his album."
As for reports that Jay's upcoming album will tell his side of the Lemonade saga, we were also told that is untrue: "He doesn't need to do that."
