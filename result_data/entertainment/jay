Beyoncé raised plenty of eyebrows at Monday's Met Gala -- for reasons other than her skintight latex gown.
The "Formation" singer made her first red carpet appearance since the release of her headline-making new album, Lemonade , without husband Jay Z or her wedding ring.
Could his absence indicate that she still ain't sorry?
"Beyoncé and Jay Z are totally fine.
Their relationship is great and doing better than ever," a source close to the couple tells ET.
"They're good."
So, why was the rapper not at his wife's side for fashion's biggest night, as he was last year?
"Jay Z didn't go to the Gala because he didn't really need to," the source explains.
"He doesn't have anything going on right now, and let's be honest, him not going all drums up excitement for his album."
As for reports that Jay's album will tell his side of the Lemonade saga, we are told that is untrue: "He doesn't need to do that."
If anything, Queen Bey used the Met Gala to squash feud rumors, first posing with former "Becky with the good hair" suspect Rita Ora .
She also attended the Balmain after-party with sister Solange, where the two were "all smiles" and "having fun," despite speculation over why she was left off Lemonade's thank you credits.
Beyoncé herself told fans that there was no drama with Jay following Lemonade controversial release, dedicating her performance of "Halo" to him during the opening night of the Formation World Tour in Miami.
"I want to dedicate this to my beautiful husband," she told the crowd.
"I love you so much."
