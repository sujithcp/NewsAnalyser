Happy Birthday, Blac Chyna !
The pregnant model and her fianc√© Rob Kardashian were spotted arriving at Miami International Airport on Wednesday, hours before her scheduled club appearance at G5ive nightclub.
Chyna, 28, and Kardashian, 29, wore matching all-black outfits as the mother-to-be concealed her baby bump with a zip-up jacket.
Wednesday's birthday celebration comes days after the engaged couple canceled two previous appearances in Hollywood and Atlantic City over the weekend following their baby announcement.
"Sorry LA & Atlantic City I really wasn't feeling well LAST night which fell over to this MORNING causing us to miss our flight," Chyna wrote in the caption of a now-deleted Instagram.
"Rob and I want to apologize for missing these events for we were looking forward to them as well but new dates are coming soon!"
Chyna appears to be celebrating a birthday month as she also has club appearances scheduled on May 14 and May 29.
