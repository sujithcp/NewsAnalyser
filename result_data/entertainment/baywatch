ET was behind the scenes and on the beach during filming for the upcoming Baywatch movie, where stars Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron said they ratcheted up the raunchiness.
In the upcoming comedy, the actors play two unlikely prospective lifeguards who are vying for jobs on the beaches of California.
"I play Matt Brody," Efron told ET.
"He's sort of like the brash, young recruit.
He doesn't necessarily see eye to eye with Mitch on many things."
Johnson plays Mitch Buchannon in the movie, a character David Hasselhoff became famous for on the '90s TV show of the same name.
Hasselhoff and his former co-star Pamela Anderson make cameos in the flick, but the stars assured us this isn't your father's Baywatch .
"It's going to be grittier, dirtier, more R[-rated]," Efron teased.
"A little more hardcore."
And of course there will be a beach full of Baywatch babes, from Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kelly Rohrbach (C.J.
Parker) to San Andreas star Alexandra Daddario (Summer Quinn).
Ilfenesh Hadera ( Chi-Raq ), who plays Stephanie Holden, promised that there will be plenty of skin, despite her conservative bathing suit.
"Stephanie Holden is the more conservative one of the bunch, so everybody that's afraid that there aren't going to be enough [gestures to her chest].
They are coming.
They are just not mine," Hadera said.
Baywatch opens May 19, 2017.
