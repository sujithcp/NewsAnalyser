West Wing alums Allison Janney and Bradley Whitford temporarily reprised their roles in the White House drama for a sketch on the Wednesday episode of James Corden's Late Late Show .
Janney, in character as C.J.
Cregg, tells Corden she wants to run through his jokes.
He suggests that rather than sit down in his convenient nearby office, it would be "more visually compelling if we walk and talk," a hat tip to Aaron Sorkin's signature West Wing style.
"Well now that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for president," begins Janney, "I love it, that's great," interrupts Corden laughing.
"That's not the joke sir, that's really happening," replies the actress.
"There's talk he's begun looking for a running mate while most Americans have begun looking for their passports."
Bradley Whitford then joins the walk-and-talk as Josh Lyman, and they all debate the merits of celebrating Cinco de Mayo too early.
When introducing tonight's guests (themselves) Whitford jokes that he's been told he looks like Bradley Whitford, "probably because I am him."
Corden jokingly has to be reminded who Janney is, as he stands next to her.
He says that even though it's 2016, it would be weird not to have them do a West Wing sketch as the conversation turns meta.
"You have to keep it short," says Whitford, prompting Corden to ask, "How short?"
"I think we should end right now," says Janney.
