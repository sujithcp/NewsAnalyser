Mila Kunis might play a “Bad Mom” in the upcoming comedy of the same name, but in real life, the 32-year-old actress’ life has changed for the better since giving birth to daughter Wyatt Isabelle in October 2014.
“I reprioritized my life, in all honesty,” Kunis told ET’s Cameron Mathison of having her daughter with husband Ashton Kutcher.
“I traveled through all my 20s and I was very selfish...
In a good way, not in a way I regret.
And I think having a kid made me realize how incredibly selfless I want to be.”
Kunis may be the newest mother out of all her Bad Moms castmates, which include Kristen Bell, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith, Kathryn Hahn, and Annie Mumolo, but all of the actresses agreed with the Black Swan star’s assessment of motherhood.
“It does change the way you think and look at life,” she added.
“I would never trade it for the world… But I know that when we decided to have a kid, we were ready to no longer be selfish.
Or at least start the process, because innately, as humans, we are really selfish people.”
According to Kunis, having her daughter even helped her discover new things about herself.
“You learn how to be a great partner and great wife and a great woman and be yourself and still be responsible for you know, a living child,” she marveled.
“It's definitely a learning process.”
The actress also said that having a toddler has also changed her priorities and time management skills, as only a baby can.
“I can let loose as much as I want, but at 6:45 in the morning she's awake, so so am I,” she revealed.
“They don't care that I let loose the night before… Honestly, I don't know what letting loose means, probably not going to sleep at 9:30.”
