There was so much baby bonding on the set of Bad Moms that star Mila Kunis tells ET she wants another child.
"I'm not pregnant ... but absolutely I do want to have more kids one day for sure," Kunis shares.
Kunis and husband Ashton Kutcher welcomed their only child together, daughter Wyatt, in October 2014, and at 32, Kunis is the youngest mother in the cast.
"Everybody in this movie is a mom," Kunis points out.
"The first thing that happens at five in the morning is, 'How'd your baby sleep?
How was the night?'
That's the first thing you ask: 'How are the kids?'"
In the film, Kunis plays Amy Mitchell, a mom whose family is her life, but when her man-child husband, high-maintenance kids and the condescending alpha moms at her kids' school push her too far, she finally snaps.
Going from good Amy to bad Amy, she teams up with two other misfit moms (Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell) to get a jolt of freedom that shakes up her life and might even make her a better mother.
While the comedy is about moms and family, star Christina Applegate clarified that it is not a family movie.
"Basically, the same sort of vile language as The Hangover s," she says.
"It's definitely not a family film."
Bad Moms , also starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Bridesmaids co-writer Annie Mumolo, hits theaters on July 29.
