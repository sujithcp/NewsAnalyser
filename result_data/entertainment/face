Kylie Jenner might be the most prolific face-swapper in Snapchat history.
The reality star put the filter to use again in a new snap with her mom Kris Jenner, commenting on the switcheroo, "This is weird ."
The 18-year-old and her 20-year-old sister, Kendall Jenner, also had some fun later on showing their grandmother how to use the app.
"Everyone says you're prettier than me," Kylie says in another snap with Kendall, using the aged face filter.
"And I don't see it."
While those filters might be pretty eerie, nothing was crazier than when Kylie face-swapped with Kim Kardashian and it was almost like nothing had changed.
