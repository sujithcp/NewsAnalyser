Britney Spears ' Instagram is packed with adorable pictures of her boys.
When she's not performing her Piece of Me show in Las Vegas, Spears clearly spends most of her downtime goofing off with Preston, 10 and Jayden, 9.
Ahead of Mother's Day, she told them just how much they mean with a touching letter written as part of Time magazine's long-running Letters From Mom series.
The essay, entitled " You Are My Masterpieces ," finds Spears giving her sons with ex Kevin Federline advice about life, love and dreams.
"You are my masterpieces.
From the day I saw the most precious eyes, I believed in miracles to the core," she wrote.
"Such a gift God has given me, exploring in your beautiful worlds every day.
I pray as a mother I teach you strength and passion to carry through the struggles in the world.
Most battles will always be won on your knees.
I pray you find your dreams."
The singer, who will perform a medley of hits at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards on May 22, added, "God always comes to us in tiny whispers.
I pray you always find his whisper and understand the true meaning behind following your inner voice as well."
The tips are practical as well as aspirational, with suggestions to "always believe in yourself and know anything is possible."
Spears, who is reportedly close to getting out from under a nearly decade-long conservatorship , told the boys that she prays "dreaming awakens your soul to limitless possibilities.
I hope the most precious mysteries of life stay with you always and you are never ashamed of how bright your light truly is.
I hope you learn praying alone is when you are most connected to God, and know you are never alone.
He is with you always.
I pray you laugh, love and soar through your journey of life."
The series has also included letters from Amber Rose, Ivanka Trump, La La Anthony, Tori Spelling and Lisa Vanderpump.
