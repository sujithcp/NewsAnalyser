Subtlety is not Khloe Kardashian ’s strong suit.
The 31-year-old reality star is watching as her estranged hubby Lamar Odom picks up his old ways, and has expressed her feelings about it several times on social media.
Late Wednesday night, Koko posted a quote on Twitter, which reads, “Damaged people are dangerous, because they know they can survive.”
The message seems to be directed at Odom after Khloe expressed similar concerns on last week’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians .
“I want him to be more afraid,” Khloe said of her ex.
“He is rare, this is like a second chance.”
After Odom was photographed drinking last week, Khloe tweeted, “Hummmmmm… People disappoint.”
The former NBA star was hospitalized last October after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel.
After being close to death, he underwent months of medical work and rehabilitation, making his first public appearance at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show in February.
Kardashian, who postponed her divorce from Odom after he entered the hospital, has expressed an interest in rekindling the flame with her ex, but noted that she wanted to make a clean break with their divorce first.
In April Odom spoke with ET about the potential divorce, saying, “We did talk, you know, everything is [up for] discussion.
We talk about anything.
We’ve been through a lot.
It won’t ever stop.”
