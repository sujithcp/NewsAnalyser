Salman Khan is sending all kinds of right feelers as far his love for Iulia Vantur is concerned.
Right from having her present at most of his outdoor location shoots, international travels (the duo were spotted in Dubai in the recent past) to intimate family affairs (Iulia was a special guest at Salman's 50 birthday bash), Salman has made sure that Iulia is looked after in the most special way possible.
And Miss Vantur is sure reciprocating with equal magnanimity.

Iulia was spotted exiting the Mumbai airport yesterday night accompanied by Salman's mother, Salma and his sister Alvira Agnihotri.
What made for an adorable sight to watch was the way Iulia held her hand out to offer support to Salma who was walking with the aid of stick.
They were returning from Punjab where Salman was busy filming the last leg of Sultan's shoot.

Before the ladies exited, Salman made his way out and remained seated in his car waiting for the women folks of his family to arrive.
A caring Iulia walked alongside Salma holding her hand firmly as they made their way towards their waiting car.
And the Romanian beauty made sure the septuagenarian was ensconced inside well enough before helping herself in.

While Iulia has been a part of Salman's family for quite a while now, it is only recently one started seeing more visible appearances of the pair together on social media and other platforms.
With Salman making no effort to hide Iulia from the public gaze and the lady herself bonding big time with the Khan family, speculations are already rife that a marriage could soon be on cards for Salman.

Grapevine whispers suggest that the wedding could well take place before the end of this year and announcement would happen post the release of his film, Sultan.
