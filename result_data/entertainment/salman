Salman Khan is all set to lose his bachelor status towards the end of 2016 and the reason is not something you think of...
Salman Khan has possibly been India's most eligible bachelor for decades now.
Every time Salman meets the press, there's this one inevitable question coming his way.
When are you finally getting married?
Bhai fans rejoice!
Our Sallu miyaan is finally on his way to turn a dulha this year-end.
As per latest reports, Salman is planning to get married to girlfriend Iulia Vantur later this year.
What brought about the change in Salman?
Well, it's not exactly what you would think.
A blind item in Mumbai Mirror reads, "So the not-young and single superstar may well be married by the year’s end.
The forever bachelor has decided that nuff’s nuff.
We hear his current girlfriend, a foreigner, may soon end up being the most powerful woman in the film biz.
Not an enviable spot, we assure you, for it isn’t her love that will make him pop ring.
Rather it’s his ailing mum, who wants to see her baby boy well taken care of.
Oh, the more things change."
It's very much guess-able that the superstar in point is Salman.
But does this mean that Salman has decided to lose his bachelor tag to make mom Salman Khan happy?
Knowing Salman's love for his mom, this might just be a huge possibility.
