Pink and her husband Carey Hart have been together for 10 years, but according to the "Try" singer, things haven't always gone smoothly.
Pink recently sat down with Ellen DeGeneres , where she got surprisingly candid about her occasionally tumultuous marriage.
"We take breaks," Pink revealed, when asked whether she and Hart often get in fights.
"We've had two breaks… the first one was about a year, and the second one was 11 months."
The 36-year-old singer admitted that both breaks came before the couple welcomed their daughter Willow in June 2011.
However, she thinks they’re "due" for another.
What is the major cause of tension between the pair?
Hart's inability to stay awake before the two can have some alone time.
"He always falls to sleep putting Willow to bed," Pink explained.
"The other night I said, 'Are you going to stay up tonight?'
And he said, 'I would like to.'
I said, 'I don’t really know what that means.
Should I light candles and open wine and put on a show like are we going big here.
Or are you going to fall asleep again?'"
Turns out, Hart fell asleep again, putting the kibosh on Pink's romantic evening.
"He sucks," Pink joked, before backpedaling to compliment her husband.
"No he's good.
He doesn't [suck].
He's very, very handsome… He's an incredible dad.
That's why he falls asleep, because [Willow] wants him to stay."
In November, Pink spoke with ET about her adorable daughter , sharing, "She's cute like her papa, and she's mean like her mama."
