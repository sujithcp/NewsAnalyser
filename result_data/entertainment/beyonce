Looks like Jennifer Lopez might be taking cues from Beyonce !
The Latin pop star, known for her dance hits, is going country with Jennifer Nettles on a duet for Nettles' upcoming album, Playing With Fire .
The song, titled "My House," features the two singers celebrating their differences as well as their similarities.
"We hang on the porch / We hang on the stoop / Our boys shootin' deer / Our boys shootin' hoops," the pair sings.
"We're really not that different / It's in the way we live / It's in way we talk / I'm Jenny from the dirt road / I'm Jenny from the Block / We're really not that different."
J.
Lo sticks to her roots on the song, even belting out part of her lyrics in Spanish.
"Mi casa es tu casa!"
she sings.
The new song, which premiered Thursday on NPR , comes one week after the release of Beyonce's new visual album, Lemonade , which features the country-tinged track, "Daddy Lessons."
Beyonce's tune has gotten mixed reviews, but Bey found a huge supporter in Blake Shelton, who had a message for all her critics when ET caught up with him backstage at The Voice on Monday.
"People that criticize can kiss my a**.
That's what I say," the country superstar told ET.
"I can't believe people that don't contribute to music that criticize music, it just blows my mind and Beyonce -- tell them to kiss that a**, is what I would do."
The Dixie Chicks also showed their devotion to the GRAMMY winner when they covered "Daddy Lessons" over the weekend during a concert in Manchester, England.
Playing With Fire drops May 13.
