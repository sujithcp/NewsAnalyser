After staying mum on the issue for months, dad Rishi Kapoor has finally broken his silence on his son's love-life.
Ranbir Kapoor has just come out of a long term relationship and is not in a mood to fall in love anytime soon.
When he was going through the tough period of break-up with girlfriend Katrina Kaif, he made sure his parents maintained a dignified silence on the matter.
Only because he didn't want matters to get worse.
Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor stayed quiet for the longest time but it's been five months to Ranbir-Katrina's break-up and now in an interview, the usually straight-forward veteran spoke about Ranbir's love life.
Talking about his son's relationships and break-ups, Rishi told Filmfare, "He's had two relationships in the past with his co-actresses.
We've had no problem.
It's up to him who he wants as a wife, as a girlfriend or work with as a co-actor.
He's most welcome to marry whoever he wants.
We'd only be happy to have a daughter in law."
Now, we all know who the two actresses he is referring to.
It's obviously Katrina and Deepika.
But we wonder who will Ranbir eventually fall in love with or get married to.
After all, as Rishi specified, all they want is a bahu for the family!
