Actor Irrfan Khan, who recently completed a decade in Hollywood, says the perception of moviegoers across the globe about India, especially its cinema, has changed with time.
“The perception of international audiences has changed with time about India, especially its cinema.
Right when we as an industry started growing and Indian films picked up the pace in film festivals around the world, the popularity grew,” said Irrfan, who has featured in Hollywood films like Slumdog Millionaire and Life of Pi .
“There are growing instances where Indian films have even done great business at the international box office.
Now the audience isn’t only restricted to Indians residing abroad, there is a growing population of westerners who are keeping a close eye on Indian films.
“Now they recognise Indian actors and are welcoming them with a lot more than just caricature-ish roles.
Our films are truly making a difference from a content perspective and is changing India’s perception of being a land of song and dance and snake charmers”.
Irrfan will be next seen in Hollywood film Inferno alongside Tom Hanks.
