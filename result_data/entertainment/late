The 37-year-old late night talk show host opened to 'O' about his father, plus a magical moment with Stevie Wonder.
This will definitely warm your heart -- and maybe even make it melt completely!
James Corden, host of the Late Late Show , shares a sweet story in the June issue of O, The Oprah Winfrey Magazine about his most memorable Father's Day.
"Five years ago, I was riding around with my dad -- he's a salesman and spends all day in his car -- when I realized that he'd used masking tape to hold a bit of the door together.
So on Father's Day, I handed him a plain box -- and inside was the key to a new Audi.
He just started crying his eyes out.
It's a great memory."

Of course, when he's not gifting cars, Corden is driving in them with some of the hottest celebrities in town for his popular Late Late Show segment, " Carpool Karaoke ."
He shares with the magazine his best "pinch me" moment.
"Driving around with Stevie Wonder for 'Carpool Karaoke' and having him call my wife and sing, I just called to say James loves you," he recalls.
"Afterward she said, 'What's happening to our lives?'"
Meanwhile, like all of us, Corden admits to having a guilty pleasure.
"A Shake Shack burger," he reveals.
"I'm deeply thankful for the line that wraps around the restaurant because it's the only thing that stops me from heading inside every day."
So, between hosting the Late Late Show , handing out awesome gifts and chowing down on the occasional burger, what does the 37-year-old talk show host like to do with what little free time he has?
"Lying down and doing absolutely nothing," he confesses.
"I'm really good at that.
I could spend an entire day staring at the corner of a rug."
Corden recently had Gwen Stefani, George Clooney and Julia Roberts join him for a 'Carpool Karaoke' to remember.
