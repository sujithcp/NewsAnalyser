Global warming is at its peak and these pretty lasses are to be blamed for it.
From divas in the Hollywood to the recently turned global stars from Bollywood, all are to be held strictly responsible for the soaring temperatures.
Just kidding but don’t they look totally jaw dropping gorgeous?
So yesterday we shared the video of Deepika Padukone hanging out with Hollywood’s popular celebrity makeup artist Hung Vanngo and somehow suspected that the ace-stylist has teamed up with our Mastani.
Hung has previously worked international icons like Selena Gomez, Julliane Moore and Cindy Crawford, yes even CINDY!
Adding up to the list is also the global favourite Priyanka Chopra for her latest magazine cover shoot.
With so much and more under his belt, Hung is now collaborated with Deepika Padukone and looks like he is totally smitten and awestruck by her beauty as much as we are.
Taking to his Instagram handle, Mr Vanngo shared picture of the actress at 6 in the morning saying, “Looking flawless like this at 6AM should be illegal.” Videos from his Snapchat account too went viral that made all DP fans mighty happy.
However, Hung shared another pic that took everyone by surprise.
“Beauty @deepikapadukone ,” he captioned the picture.
After thoroughly stalking this ace-make up stylist’s Insta account, we have come to a conclusion that he has teamed up with some BIG names from industries all over the world.
We’re so excited, keep the pictures coming you people!
Deepika also dropped by popular designer Prabal Gurung’s place at NYC.
