Attention Magic Mike fans: star Channing Tatum is making it rain, again, with the announcement of a live stage version of his star-studded stripper dramedy and it's 2015 sequel.
"This is my first Facebook-y live-y thing," Tatum says in his first-ever 'live' post on the social media platform .
"I've got a big announcement.
We are going to be doing Magic Mike Live in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel Casino in coming March next year.
I'm going to introduce you to some of the guys who are going to be in the show, they've been working really hard.
I can't get away from those double entendres," he adds playfully.
"I'm going to let everybody introduce themselves and hopefully in the coming months you guys will get to know them better."
Tatum then turns the camera to pan and introduce the show's handsome cast members and choreographer Alison Faulk, who choreographed those memorable dance numbers featured in the two films.
"The show will be previewing March of next year," Tatum continued.
"We've partnered with Cosmopolitan magazine to start a conversation with you guys and we really need to hear what it is that you want.
We want to change what male entertainment has been for years.
We want to make it better, it's time.
I hate when I say it, but it's time to revolutionize and times are a changing so we've got to do some different stuff, make it more of a conversation rather than men going up there and telling you what you think is sexy."
"It should be empowering women instead of the guys going up there and getting naked."
Tatum teases that should he manage to get himself back into Magic Mike shape again, he will "absolutely" consider making an appearance in the show, "because it's fun," he says.
"I'm sure there will be a lot of crazy cameos.
We have nothing scheduled because we want to make sure the show stands on its own, but I am going to direct it with Faulk and Teresa Espinoza choreographing.
We're already having a lot of fun coming up with things you've never seen before.
Tickets will be available soon."
BRB, checking flights to Las Vegas for March 2017.
