Surprise!
Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis got a special Mother’s Day treat on Friday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
The Bad Moms co-stars first watched a video from their husbands – Dax Shepard and Ashton Kutcher – wishing them a Happy Mother’s Day.
But the cuteness was amplified when the actors joined their wives on the show to play a game of “Never Have We Ever.”
It turns out they’ve all hooked up on set, and they’ve all helped to “groom” their spouse’s body parts.
“I was pregnant.
I didn’t groom him, he groomed me when I was pregnant, right before I went to the hospital,” Kunis said of Kutcher.
Shepard and Bell also revealed some marriage secrets.
When ask if they had ever thrown anything of their partner’s away, Shepard responded, “Every time she goes out of town for more than 48 hours, I get rid of about 20 things.
But luckily her memory’s so terrible, she has no idea.”
And when DeGeneres asked if they’d been in handcuffs and Shepard replied that he had, Bell exclaimed, “He’s talking about another partner, Ellen!”
“No, no, no, no I’m talking about the police and stuff,” Shepard quickly backtracked.
Before their hubbies crashed the interview, Bell and Kunis opened up about the possibility of expanding their families.
While the Frozen actress is happy with her two kids, Kunis is ready to give baby Wyatt a sibling.
“Are you trying?” DeGeneres asked.
“Like am I having sex?” Kunis joked, laughing.
“Yes, I want to know how often,” the host teased.
“Like yes, not like that, but yes,” the actress replied, blushing.
