The 'Money Monster' Cannes red carpet was definitely interesting. 
 
 
Amal Clooney's first Cannes Film Festival red carpet didn't exactly go off without a hitch.
The always fashionable 38-year-old human rights lawyer looked incredible in an elegant one-shoulder Versace gown at the Money Monster premiere on Thursday, accompanying her husband, George Clooney.
But the famous red steps at the Palais des Festivals proved to be difficult thanks to the dress' show-stopping train, which caused her to stumble a bit.

At one point, Amal needed two escorts to help her climb the steps, as the rest of the Money Monster cast looked on.

The sexy thigh-high slit of her dress also proved to be a bit of a problem, when it accidentally flew up as she posed for more pictures.

Still, there's no denying how stunning Amal looked on the Cannes red carpet.
Sporting orange drop earrings and wearing her hair in sideswept waves, bold red lipstick completed her latest gorgeous look.

Although, to be fair, Amal wasn't the only one having red carpet issues.
George's Money Monster co-star, Julia Roberts, didn't even attempt to climb the steps in heels, opting instead to go barefoot in her black Armani Prive gown.

Julia, 48, talked to InStyle magazine earlier this month about this year being her first Cannes Film Festival experience ever, admitting that despite her A-list status, she had more than a little anxiety.
"Have you ever watched it on television?
It looks terrifying," Julia said.
"It looks as scary as someone saying, 'OK, so this is the position that youâ€™re going to play in the Super Bowl for 2017.'
I've kind of avoided it."
"But it seems like you have to walk a very long distance and then a lot of stairs," she added.
No worries, Julia -- you nailed it, barefoot and all!
