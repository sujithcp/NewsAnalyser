The theme for this year's star-studded Met Gala was "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology," meaning that many of the big-name celebs and style icons tried their hand at blending futurism and fashion .
For some, it worked wonderfully.
For others, their outfits ended up looking like costumes from low-budget 1980s sci-fi movies.
From awkward silver suits of armor to circuit board jackets, it seems the future of technology when it comes to clothing might look a lot like Tron .
But not every eyebrow-raising moment came from an overly-literal interpretation of the gala's theme.
Some outfits were just plain weird, while others seemed to forget how clothes are even supposed to work.
Here are a few of the weirdest styles, fashions and red-carpet choices made by the stars at this year's black-tie event.

Lady Gaga either needs to try harder or just embrace the classy elegance she's been trying for the last few months.
Once you've worn a meat dress, a circuit board jacket, giant wig and black underwear combo just isn't breaking new ground.

Everything about this is weird.
The buttless chaps, the exposed breasts , the forehead jewelry -- all of it.

It's like they forgot what direction a skirt was supposed to go, so it blocked her face for most of the gala.

Eschewing the all-black ensemble most vampires lean toward, the Suicide Squad star brought his trusty cane to the black-tie affair to show the world that vampire kings are not afraid of the sun, like we all assumed.

It's nice that the fashion designer raised the topic of the plight of American butterflies during her time on the red carpet.
Next year, maybe she could wear some whales.

Say what you will about this hair style (it's like a wacky version of Marge Simpson's beehive), Nyong'o is the only star who could still look that flat-out amazing with that kind of 'do.

The "Black Widow" singer gave Bjork's infamous swan dress a run for its money when it comes to the "amount of total bird" her dress is made of.
Actually, she looks like a sexier, more silvery Babette the feather duster from The Beauty and the Beast .
