From Beyonce to fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker, the A-listers were out in full force at Monday night's star-studded 2016 Met Gala in New York City.
But which stylish stars ruled the red carpet, and whose looks fell spectacularly flat?
Check out our round-up of the best and worst-dressed at the Met Gala.
When it comes to commitment and effort, nobody came close to Katy Perry this year.
The 31-year-old "Dark Horse" singer had jaws dropping in a lush, multi-colored velvet Prada gown, featuring a sexy open back and a dramatic train.

But it's the obvious attention to detail that makes her ensemble so special.
Perry's dress featured everyone's favorite '90s toy, the Tamagotchi -- giving a cute nod to the year's technology theme -- and the fingerless black leather gloves only enhanced her edgy vibe.
Bleached eyebrows and moody black lipstick were also a perfect complement to her show-stopping look.

Madonna's fearless style is always welcome, but it's safe to say her NSFW black lacy Givenchy getup -- featuring bare butt cut-outs -- wasn't her best.

... And it wasn't much better from the front.
