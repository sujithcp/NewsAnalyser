A lot of folks probably thought that Captain America: Civil War would be a fight so big, it'd fit the entire storyline of its namesake into one film.
Thankfully, that sentiment has been proven wrong, as Joe and Anthony Russo have started to speak about the level of conflict our Avengers will be at when they regroup in The Avengers: Infinity War  Part 1 .
Let's just say that there's still room for improvement between the team.
The greatest indication specifically came from Joe Russo, as his remarks to USA Today set the tone for what writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have started to include in their drafts of The Avengers: Infinity War .
Russo made the following proclamation about just where Earth's mightiest heroes will start their epic two-part journey:
Without question, were taking these characters who are at the height of dysfunction and animosity, and were going to put them into a story where theyre going to have to face the greatest threat theyve ever known.
Despite Captain America: Civil War being titled after the massive, multi-issue story arc that saw the Superhero Registration Act turn hero against hero, there was never going to be enough room in one film to tell the entire story.
And even if there were, with such a huge story in the hands of The Russos, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, they wouldn't want to cram all of the excitement and pathos into the beginning of Phase 3.
Instead, the current phase of films should follow a trajectory that explores the issue throughout the introduction of such heroes as Black Panther , Doctor Strange , and Captain Marvel .
The most interesting part about the Sokovia Accords ruling the Phase 3 storyline between Captain America: Civil War and The Avengers: Infinity War , is the fact that these new heroes will be developing and discovering powers in a time that isn't as free about their usage as the past two phases.
While Black Panther's T'challa has already discovered his mantle of responsibility, Stephen Strange and Carol Danvers will be starting down their paths to super-heroism with the likes of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Tony Stark keeping an eye on them.
With new powers come new responsibilities, and by time Thanos comes to town in his two-pronged showdown, these new folks will have to choose to fight or die in the eyes of intergalactic menace.
Of course, the open ended nature of Captain America: Civil War's conflict leaves open tons of doors that could, and probably will, be closed at a later date.
So those of you who thought Steve Rogers completely dodged his bullet of destiny, you might want to hold off on the celebrations until after The Avengers: Infinity War .
Part 1 will arrive in theaters on May 4th, 2018, with Part 2 following up on May 3rd, 2019.
