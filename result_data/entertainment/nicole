Kim Kardashian West's latest necklace makes quite the statement.
The 35-year-old reality star stepped out in Havana, Cuba, with husband Kanye West on Wednesday, and she accessorized with a choker from the late Nicole Brown Simpson.

Kim previously showed off the special piece of jewelry on Snapchat, captioning the selfie, "My mom's necklace.
Gift from Nicole Brown Simpson #1988"
Nicole was brutally murdered in June 1994 and the now-infamous court case surrounding her death was recently brought back to the spotlight with The People v. O.J.

Kris Jenner opened up to ET about their friendship and the last vacation she took with Nicole.
"That was such a fun trip," she recalled of the Easter getaway with their respective kids.
"Nicole was in charge of music because she was so good at her playlists.
I remember we watched Pretty Woman probably 10 times on that trip.
It was our last vacation together."
Kim and Kanye – along with 2-year-old daughter North, Kourtney Kardashian and her 6-year-old son, and Khloé Kardashian – jet setted to Cuba following Sunday's Met Gala.
The trip isn't without controversy though, as Khloé ignited backlash when she posted an Instagram posing next to a wall that said "Fidel" on it.
Though she never issued an apology, the 31-year-old KUWTK star commented, "I'm so blessed to be able to appreciate another's culture.
God is GREAT!
Thank you for my opportunities."
