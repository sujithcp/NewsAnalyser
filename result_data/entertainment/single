Justin Timberlake can't stop the feeling -- and we're not just talking about his latest single .
The 35-year-old hit-maker gushed over his wife, Jessica Biel , in a sweet Mother's Day Instagram post on Sunday.
The picture shows Biel, 34, holding the couple's son, 1-year-old Silas, in her arms.
"M.I.L.F.
Alert!!!!
Happy Mother's Day to this AMAZING MOM AND WIFE," Timberlake wrote.
"And, to all of the mothers out there... You keep the World turning!!
Hope every single one of you has an amazing day!"
Timberlake, who has just released a new single, "Can't Stop The Feeling" for the Trolls movie soundtrack, recently teased more new music and opened up about how being a new dad has changed him.
"Yes, having a little man in the house now changes everything!"
he said.
"When I used to clean up my dog's poop, it was like it was a science project; I wouldn't get very close to it.
When you have a kid and there's poop, you got to get in there!
Nothing trumps your kid's butt cleanliness, so you just have to get in there!"
