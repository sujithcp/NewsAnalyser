Tough-as-nails dance instructor Abby Lee Miller showed a more vulnerable side when she sat down with spirit medium Monica Ten-Kate, who says she's able to communicate with dead people.
Monica, the star of Monica the Medium (airing Mondays on Freeform), brought Abby to tears with her spot-on description of her late mother, Maryen Lorrain Miller.
Maryen, who was known to Dance Moms viewers as "The Original Dance Mom," died from cancer in 2014 at 86.
"She really didn't want you to know the severity of her cancer," Monica tells an emotional Abby in a clip.
It was Monica's mention of Maryen's Catholic faith practices and rosary beads that gave Miller full confidence in Monica's medium abilities.
"This Monica girl -- I think she's the real deal," Abby told ET.
"It's a relief.
It's nice to know, because you wonder."
Monica explained how her gift works, saying, "It's not like I walk into a store and I see 50 dead people right in front of me.
I will see, feel, hear, sense things all at the same time."
The one misstep came when Monica made an assumption about Abby's love life, asking if she had been married or was dating someone when her mother was sick.
"That was a little strange, because I don't really have a love life," Abby admitted.
The reading was shot for Dance Moms , which returns this fall to Lifetime.
