A memorial event to honor the late pop star Prince is scheduled to take place Friday, May 6 from 5 to 8 p.m. on the Spring Street steps of Los Angeles City Hall, with thousands expected to attend.
The lineup for the event: Prince-associated act The Time, Faith Evans, Kenny Lattimore, Eric Benet, Aloe Blacc plus more, according to a press release from L.A. City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson's office.
The mayor and several members of the City Council are also scheduled to attend.
Streets in the area closed for the event starting at 5 a.m., with street closures along Spring Street at West 1st Street and West Temple Street all day until 9 p.m.
Parking at City Hall is closed to the general public, so Harris-Dawson's office advised in a press release to take the Metro to the Grand Park/Civic Center station.
Metro buses with routes nearby were also set to be detoured.
Harris-Dawson's office led the effort to put together the tribute, officially announcing the event on Thursday, April 28.
They worked with community organizers and other officials on the event.
L.A. City Hall was the main location for Prince's "Diamonds and Pearls" music video and was lit purple in tribute following Prince's death.
L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti posted images from the video on Instagram:
"Diamonds and Pearls" video director Rebecca Blake talked about the City Hall shoot in an interview on the Golden Age of Music Video's website:
"That’s the current L.A. City Hall.
I mean, what was very — oh, another humorous thing was when we were shooting, the amount of the streets that were blocked off and the security and the amount of Winnebagos, I mean, it was so immense that I had trouble getting into my own shoot!
The amount of security that I had to go through was incredible.
I was saying, 'Let me in, I’m the director.'"
