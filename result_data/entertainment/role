Remember Shruti Haasan’s sister in 3? That was Gabriella, who will soon be seen in 'Appa'.
Gabriella is excited about entering Class XII.
Like any teenager, she is extremely impatient about growing up and being called an “adult”.
Her tryst with showbiz started when she was just nine, with dance show Jodi No.
1 Junior .
From winning titles in reality dance competitions to her entry into Kollywood, she says that she has moved on from being that little kid to an actor with her own identity.
She was an ardent fan of Dhanush, and bagging a role in 3 was a big deal for her.
She recalls, “I was very nervous and all I did was imitate him.”
That, and a role in Chennaiyil Oru Naal , gave her some much-needed experience.
But what was challenging was balancing school life and life on the sets.
“It was very difficult to go to school in the morning and shoot immediately afterwards.
My mother and I would sometimes come home only at 4 a.m. and I’d get just a couple of hours of sleep before getting ready for school.”
The feedback she received about her acting kept her motivated.
“When people say that I have evolved as an actor and that I have grown up, I feel very happy about it,” she gushes.
Gabriella’s upcoming film is Appa , in which she has an important role.
“Working with Samuthirakani sir was inspiring; I have learnt a lot from this project,” she says, adding, “From being a younger sister or a passive daughter to having my own identity on the big screen is amazing.”
Her dream role?
“I wish Dhanush directs a film someday and I get cast in it.”
