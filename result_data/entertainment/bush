The singer lends his support as a pal tries a &quot;sexy&quot; wedding dress on for size. 
 
 
Kristian Bush is learning a whole lot about the world of bridal fashion!
The former Sugarland musician -- who released his debut solo effort, Southern Gravity , last year -- makes an appearance on this week's episode of Say Yes to the Dress to help a friend pick out her perfect wedding day ensemble.
Among the options: a "sexy" bridal romper!
See the ripped-from-the-runway look in ET's exclusive clip, above.
"There's a lot more to wedding dress shopping than I had anticipated," Bush tells ET.
"I donâ€™t think I realized how many different styles there were, or even how many different colors of white existed.
Also, those things can get expensive!
I got a crash course in the language of dresses."
Adding with a cheeky grin: "I will never be the same again!"
Earlier this year, the hit TLC reality show underwent a bit of a musical makeover with a brand new theme song from Bush.
Listen to "Forever Now (Say Yes)" below.
Meanwhile, Bush is also hard at worked on his next studio album.
"I'm about a month into writing and recording my new album right now, and I love how it sounds so far," he said.
"I feel a responsibility to make music that makes people feel good when they hear it.
Music that makes me feel good when I play it.
It's something I discovered on Southern Gravity and I'm committed to staying in that groove."
