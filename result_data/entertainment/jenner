Kristin Cavallari has no love lost for Brody Jenner!
The reality star talked to ET's Katie Krause at the re-launch party for her jewelry line, Emerald Duv, where she gushed about her former flame and his fiancee , Kaitlynn Carter.
"I love Brody, and she's so sweet," the former Hills star admits.
"So I'm really, really happy for them."
"It's such an exciting time in both of their lives and I know Linda, his mom, loves her, so she must be so excited," she adds.
"And so, I just think it's awesome."
Cavallari and Jenner split in 2006, and the 29-year-old married NFL quarterback Jay Cutler in 2013.
It's an exciting time for Jenner and his bride-to-be, who announced their engagement last week, in a super romantic beach pic on Instagram.
Jenner wrote: "On May 4th 2016 I got engaged to my lover and my best friend @kaitlynn_carter.
I couldn't be more in love with this woman and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her."
And it should be known that the rock Jenner picked out... pretty big, pretty gorgeous.
Meanwhile, in addition to her jewelry line, Cavallariâ€™s also got a 5-month-old baby girl taking up her time!
The mom of three talked a little bit to ET about how grabby kids can change up your jewelry style.
"They pull on everything," she explains.
"Luckily my style when it comes to jewelry has always been very simple and effortless.
And so, everything that is in the collection does work with having children.
Because there's nothing too, too dangly or too big that they are going to pull on."
