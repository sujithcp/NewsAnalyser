'Church Chat' welcomed guests Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
Church Chat's famous Church Chat host, the Church Lady, returned to Saturday Night Live on May 7, welcoming back SNL vet Dana Carvey, who interviewed Ted Cruz ("Satan") and Donald Trump ("an orange mannequin").
Carvey chatted about the current election “between a godless liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton,” before addressing fashion at the Met Gala.
She had a lot to say about Madonna's ensemble, and called Beyonce's look “a giant latex condom."
But then the real guests of the hour appeared.
"Please welcome: Satan," Carvey introduced her first guest, as Ted Cruz walked in.
“I was just quoting one of your colleagues, Teddy,” Carvey said, referencing John Boehner's jab at Cruz, calling him Lucifer.
"John’s always coming up with hilarious nicknames for me," Cruz replied, defending his friendship with Boehner and his “strong Christian values."
“Has anyone ever told you that you’re just a little preachy?” Church Lady (Carvey) asked him.
"Was it part of god's plan for you to get humiliated by an orange mannequin?”
When she asked him about his plans now that he's dropped out of the race , Cruz replied that he's "been thinking about turning evil," as he tried out his evil laugh.
So Church Lady abandoned him for her next guest, Trump.
"Welcome the tangerine tornado, Donald J. Trump," she welcomes fellow SNL vet Darrell Hammond.
He assured her he is an avid churchgoer, saying he sometimes even goes when its not “church day” and he loves all the books in the Bible, including “Corinthians Part Deux," and "'Too Genesis, Too Furious,' which says, and I quote, love your neighbor as thyself, and like a good neighbor, State Farm is there."
In the end, their interview was interrupted by Cruz trying out his new role as Satan.
