Madonna is hitting back at critics over her risqu√© outfit choices.
While many criticized her for choosing such a revealing getup, Madge explained on Wednesday that her Met look was a "political statement" in support of gender equality.
"We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world.
When it comes to Women's rights we are still in the dark ages," Madonna explained in a lengthy caption on Instagram.
"My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement."
Adding, "The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an age-ist and sexist society.
I have never thought in a limited way and I'm not going to start.
We cannot effect change unless we are willing to take risks By being fearless and By taking the road leas traveled by.
Thats how we change history."
Madonna's fashion followers were hardly surprised to see the mother of four don a no-pants number to this year's Met.
The Rebel Heart hitmaker previously rocked a for the 2013 "Punk: Chaos to Couture" Gala.
Nevertheless, the "Vogue" singer addressed her haters by concluding her post saying, "If you have a problem with the way I dress it is simply a reflection of your prejudice.
I'm not afraid to pave the way for all the girls behind me As Nina Simone once said, the definition of freedom is being fearless.
I remain Unapologetic and a Rebel in this life and all the others.
Join my fight for Gender.
Equality!"
That same day, Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci supported his friend and muse on Instagram writing, "BEST RED CARPET EVER NOT ONLY WITH M THE ICON, BUT ALSO M THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HUMAN AND FRIEND."
