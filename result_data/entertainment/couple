Adele has helped yet another couple get engaged!
During her Copenhagen, Denmark concert on Tuesday, the British singer invited André Söderberg and Simon Carlsson on stage, and much to her surprise, a marriage proposal went down.
As seen in fan-recorded videos, Adele, 28, holds the microphone for the duo, then proceeds to jump up and down before saying "that's amazing, I'm going to cry" and giving congratulatory hugs.
"Should I be your surrogate if you have children?
I'd love to have a baby with someone Swedish," she also told the newly engaged couple on stage.
Concertgoers said the Oscar winner selected the couple out of the audience for wearing quirky eyewear.
Söderberg later told the Evening Standard that the proposal was completely unplanned.
"I had been thinking about asking him to marry me but when Adele invited us to the stage, it just happened," he said.
"I had a plastic ring on which we had bought earlier in the day when we were buying costumes, so I took that ring and put it on his finger.
What can I say - I just love him so much!"
In March, the 25 hitmaker kicked off her world tour in Belfast, Northern Ireland where she helped a couple get engaged.
