Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne may have split up after more than 33 years of marriage.
A spokesman for the couple told the Press Association: "At this time Ozzy is not at the marital home."
The Black Sabbath frontman, 67, has been fighting a public battle with drug and alcohol addiction for decades.
The couple have been rumoured to have temporarily split up before, however this time reports suggest the singer's addictions are not to blame.
In 2013, Mrs Osbourne, 63, a former judge on The X factor, denied claims the pair were getting divorced after her husband relapsed.
She insisted their marriage was not in trouble and that they were working hard to resolve their problems.
The couple married in 1982 and found themselves enjoying a fresh wave of fame 20 years later when their family became the subject of hit MTV documentary The Osbournes.
