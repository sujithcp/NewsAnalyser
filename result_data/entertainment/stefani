'The Voice' coach joined James Corden and two Oscar winners for 'The Late Late Show' segment.
Gwen Stefani sat shotgun with two Academy Award winners in the back for James Corden's latest Carpool Karaoke on Wednesday.
Stefani joined The Late Late Show host to sing some of her new hits, remember her No Doubt days and act out popular emojis.
She even took a few moments to slowly explain the rapid lyrics of "Sweet Escape."
Starting out strong with No Doubt's "Don't Speak," Corden told Stefani she's like "Benjamin Button" because she's "ageless."
She explained that she "started falling in love" and "that's like what a facelift is, I think."
So Corden concluded that "if you meet a country music singer who happens to be an absolute hunk, you'll just go back in time!"
They then played a quick game of acting out emojis, including the sideways kiss and the "red lady in the dress dancing."
She couldn't quite act out eggplant, though.
But then they hit the "HOV 4" lane, where drivers need at least four drivers in the car, so Stefani and Corden had to call up some friends to get in the back seat.
So Money Monster's Julia Roberts and George Clooney hopped in to help the duo sing Queen's "We Are the Champions" and Stefani's "Hollaback Girl."
Clooney especially shined during the "that s**t is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S" part of Stefani's song.
Clooney even had his own thoughts of what a "hollaback girl" meant: "If some guys are on a construction site, and they're yelling at a girl, she's not going to turn back, she's not that kind of a girl."
Stefani told the group that she'll never tell who the real inspiration of the song was, to which Clooney told her: "This s**t is bananas."
