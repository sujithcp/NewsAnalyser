Justin Timberlake has just released his first single in more than two years.
Timberlake, who has won nine Grammys and has notched 16 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, debuted his latest song, "Can't Stop the Feeling," on his Vevo channel Thursday night.
He had posted a sneak peek video on Twitter earlier on Thursday, previewing the song with a dance party featuring his Trolls co-stars Anna Kendrick, James Corden, Gwen Stefani and Ron Funches.
The artist hasn't released new original music since The 20/20 Experience â€“ 2 of 2, which debuted in late 2013.
He is also serving as the executive music producer for Trolls , writing original music for the film, which includes this song and others on the soundtrack.
He also voices the character of Branch in the film alongside Anna Kendrick, who plays Princess Poppy.
Fox has slated the film for a Nov. 4, 2016 release date.
