Actor Simbu was in the news last year for all the wrong reasons – he was caught in controversy over his leaked ‘Beep Song’.
Clearly, the actor is trying to make amends.
He has come out with a ‘Vote Song’, urging people to vote on May 16, polling day.
The song, which starts off with the lines Vote Podu Mama, has been sung and composed by the actor himself.
Ganesh, who is known for his role in Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya, is also credited as a singer.
The actor’s Idhu Namma Aalu is slated to hit screens soon.
He has also Gautham Menon’s Accham Enbadhu Madamayada up his sleeve; the Thalli Pogathey single that was released is already popular among youngsters.
