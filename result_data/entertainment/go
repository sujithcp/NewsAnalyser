They're gonna go ahead and break our hearts one more time. 
 
 
Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are bringing their romance to the 2016 Billboard Music Awards!
The couple is set to perform their new duet, "Go Ahead and Break My Heart," on the BBMAs stage on Sunday, May 22, airing live from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on ABC at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.
The duo previously debuted the track in a live performance on the show that introduced them â€“ The Voice.
ET was with Shelton backstage shortly before hitting the stage at The Voice , where he opened up about the process of writing the "honest" song together.
"When I originally started writing this song that we're performing tonight, I was only trying to impress Gwen," Shelton, 39, said.
"I started this song and wrote about half of it and sent it to her and she wrote the other half of it.
It was just kind of something for she and I to help us feel better about what we were going through," he added, referring to both of their divorces.
And despite the song's somber lyrics, the new couple couldn't help but beam all the way through their rehearsals.
"The hardest part was not smiling throughout the whole thing while we're singing it because we can't believe this is happening.
We still can't believe this is happening," he explained.
"It's cool to be witness to something that's this honest and fun."
"Go Ahead and Break My Heart" is featured on Shelton's forthcoming album, If I'm Honest , which will be released on May 20.
Elsewhere on the BBMAs stage, Nick Jonas and Tove Lo will deliver a live rendition of their collaboration, "Close," while Justin Bieber, Celine Dion, DNCE, Fifth Harmony featuring Ty Dolla $ign, The Go-Go's, Demi Lovato, Shawn Mendes, Pink, Britney Spears and Troye Sivan are also set to perform.
Madonna will also grace the stage in a tribute to Prince .
The show is produced by dick clark productions with Ludacris and Ciara on tap to co-host.
