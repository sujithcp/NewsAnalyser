Eddie Redmayne joins 'Early Man'
Aardman's upcoming prehistoric soccer animation film Early Man has landed one of the U.K.'s most famous voices.
Eddie Redmayne has joined the adventure, being directed by Nick Park.
voicing a central caveman character called Dug, Aardman and StudioCanal announced Monday.
Redmayne, soon to be seen in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , is the first voice to be be revealed.
"Not only is Eddie a joy to work with, his versatility and boundless energy have really helped to bring my new character to life," said Parks.
"He embodies the cheeky charm, fun and plucky wit of Dug, and I’m sure he’ll get along brilliantly with Dug’s sidekick Hognob.”
Set at the dawn of time, when prehistoric creatures and woolly mammoths roamed the earth, Early Man tells the story of Dug, along with sidekick Hognob, unites his tribe against the mighty Bronze Age in a battle to beat them at their own game.
The film marks Park’s first feature since Academy Award-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, his fourth Oscar victory.
Aardman and StudioCanal also worked together on the Shaun the Sheep Movie , which grossed more than $80 million last year.
StudioCanal is co-financing Early Man and will distribute it in its own territories, the U.K., France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, selling worldwide.
The British Film Institute is also a partner on the film.
