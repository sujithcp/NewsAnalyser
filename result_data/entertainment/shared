Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon understand how to make co-parenting look easy.
The "Without You" singer and her ex-husband shared a friendly pre-Mother's Day family dinner with their adorable 5-year-old twins , Monroe and Moroccan.
The 35-year-old America's Got Talent host shared the smiling snapshot to Instagram on Thursday, captioning the cute pic, "A little dinner after Karate Class!!"
The former couple have been the epitome of amicable exes since calling in quits in 2014 after six years of marriage, spending several holidays and special occasions together for their kids.
Cannon was vocally supportive of Carey's recent engagement to billionaire businessman James Packer back in January.
Cannon shared his congrats on Instagram , writing, "May god bless your future union."
