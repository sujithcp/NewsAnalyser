The 35-year-old reality star is stepping up her shoe game!
Kim Kardashian West's post-baby fashion has taken an interesting turn!
The 35-year-old reality star was spotted heading to lunch at Katsuya in Hollywood, California, on Wednesday, rocking yet another revealing, semi-confusing ensemble.
Kim sported a pair of thigh-high lace-up Tony Bianco boots, which she paired with a lace-up bodysuit and black zip-up jacket.
She also donned oversized sunglasses and a thick choker necklace , an accessory many stars have taken a liking to as of late.

In typical Kardashian fashion , the mother of two took to Snapchat to give her fans a close-up look at her fierce shoe selection of the day.
Since giving birth to her and husband Kanye West's second child, Saint , in December, Kim has been very vocal about her weight-loss journey .
In April, she told fans via Snapchat that she was down to 139.6 pounds.
"YOU GUYS!!!!!
PRE BABY WEIGHT WAS 135!!!!!"
she captioned a pic of her standing on a scale.
Kim also revealed over her app that she credits old photos of herself as inspiration, specifically ones that were taken of her slimmed-down figure just a few months after giving birth to her first child, North , who is now two years old.
While Kim has been appearing as confident as ever lately, her youngest sister, Kylie Jenner, admits she's been feeling "vulnerable" in a series of honest videos posted to Snapchat.
"I donâ€™t know who Kylie Jenner is," the 18-year-old lip kit maven revealed on Wednesday, amid her breakup with rapper Tyga.
