Britney Spears' style has been copied one more time.
Kendall Jenner stunned at last Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner , where she chatted with President Barack Obama while wearing a strapless, curve-hugging black Vivienne Westwood gown.
However, all eyes were on the major bling around the 20-year-old model's neck -- and that ice may have looked familiar.

Sure enough, jewelry designer Lorraine Schwartz revealed via Instagram on Wednesday that the diamond choker is indeed the same "classic" style that Britney Spears wore to the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards .
"The first one I made in 2002 that #britneyspears wore to the 2002 #vma's to the one #kendalljenner wore to the 2016 shows that a #classic is classic forever even if it's a little #funkyðŸ˜‰ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž #lorraineschwartzjewelry#goodthingslastforever," Schwartz captioned a side-by-side split of Jenner and Spears.
Though both ladies were clad in black for their respective affairs, Spears' outfit 14 years ago was quite different from the elegance Jenner had on display in Washington, D.C.
In fact, the correct words for the oh-so-aught ensemble that the "Toxic" singer rocked to the VMAs -- an asymmetrical, low-cut leather halter dress, strappy knee-high sandals, fingerless leather arm warmers and cop-inspired cap -- are "interesting," "daring," or "huh."

Not only can both ladies say they stole the show in that Lorraine Schwartz necklace, they also spent time with two huge names while wearing them -- Jenner met Obama , while Spears held hands with Michael Jackson on stage.

Pretty girls, indeed.
