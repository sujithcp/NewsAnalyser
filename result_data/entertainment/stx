Kathy Savitt is leaving STX Entertainment after eight months at her post as president of digital, The Hollywood Reporter can confirm.
Savitt was brought into the Hollywood studio last September from Yahoo, where she served as CMO, to oversee all global digital content strategy.
"In a time of unprecedented change in the media industry, STX is redefining storytelling," Savitt said at the time of her hiring.
"Viewers are in control and each film or show has to earn its space in their time on its own merit.
What we are doing at STX hasn't been done before; we are creating a new way for audiences to access meaningful stories, from wherever they are."
"Kathy's combined expertise in marketing and digital content creation is unparalleled," STX CEO Robert Simonds had said.
"Her industry experience and creative vision will establish STX Digital as a new and disruptive force in the entertainment industry as we tell compelling stories to a global audience.
She has keen insights into storytelling that meets digital and television viewers where they watch."
At Yahoo, where Savitt was one of CEO Marissa Mayer's first hires, she spearheaded the 2014 acquisition of NBC's Community andtook on the role of head of media before departing the company.
STX had no comment on the parting.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report the news on Thursday, citing sources who say Savitt is leaving to work on a startup venture.
THR was able to confirm that Savitt has a startup currently in stealth mode that will focus on distributing content directly to consumers.
