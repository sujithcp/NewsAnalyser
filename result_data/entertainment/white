Kim Kardashian Wears Skintight White Dress Exploring Cuba With Kanye West
Presented By &
The couple was seen grabbing a bite to eat without their daughter North West, who had previously been sightseeing with them.
Kim was spotted wearing a skintight white dress, complete with a ruffled neckline and sleeves, and powder blue heels.
Later on in the day, the 35-year-old opted to remove the frilly top and wear the white dress on its own.
Meanwhile, the Life of Pablo rapper looked comfortable in a gray shirt, matching Yeezy Boost sneakers and a pair of jeans.
In fact, the Grammy winner wore the same denim pants that he had on for the 2016 Met Gala earlier this week.
Déjà vu denim, indeed.
Khloe has been documenting her trip with her family on Instagram for all to see, while her sisters have remained fairly mum on social media.
"Pablo was here!"
Khloe shared on Twitter Wednesday afternoon in one of the family's first official photos from the trip, this one of their dinner at the famous Cristóbal Paladar restaurant in Havana.
This trip marks the first time that the group has visited Cuba and comes on the heels of the group traveling to Iceland just a few weeks ago.
