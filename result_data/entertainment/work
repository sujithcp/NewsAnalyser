The actress, who is currently termed as one of the most successful actresses in Bollywood, thanks to her films like 'Aashiqui 2', 'Ek Villain' and 'Haider', had a low phase in her career when she started off.
When asked how the industry reacted when she delivered a flop film like 'Teen Patti', she said: "That time, things were different.
Post 'Teen Patti', nobody was easily offering films and it was difficult to let people believe in me after coming out of an unsuccessful film.
But there were few people who believed in me including Mohit Suri, director of 'Aashiqui 2'.
""It feels nice that people now want to work with me.
The best part of the actor is to get the love of the audience," she added.
Shraddha is currently seen in Tiger Shroff starrer 'Baaghi'.Recommended By Colombia
