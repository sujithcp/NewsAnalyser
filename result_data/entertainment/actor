Sonam Kapoor has been dedicating a lot of time to staying fit of late.
We recently reported that the actor has taken to aerial yoga, an exercise routine she found out about in Austria, when she was vacationing there with her family.
Now, we have come to know that since the actor doesn’t want to miss out on her daily workout routine, she has decided to get her trainer, Radhika Karle, to accompany her to the upcoming Cannes Film Festival.
A source close to Sonam says, “She has been training with Radhika for quite some time now.
Her regular training consists of Pilates and aerial yoga.
She will be at the festival for a few days, and she doesn’t want to miss out on her training while she’s there.”
The actor has apparently become so disciplined about her workouts that she took time out for her yoga sessions even when she was on holiday.
“Sonam is also very careful about what she eats.
She prefers eating food that is low on carbs,” adds the source.
We tried contacting the Bollywood actor, but she remained unavailable for a comment.
