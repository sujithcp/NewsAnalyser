/5-times-actresses-proved-they-needed-no-men-to-make-a-hit/The-Dirty-Picture/eventshow/52108837.cms‘Filmein sirf teen cheezon ki wajah se chalti hain… entertainment, entertainment, entertainment,” said Vidya Balan in her super successful 2011 film, ‘The Dirty Picture.’ And well, entertain she did.
Not only did Vidya earn accolades for her performance and set cash registers jingling with a total collection of Rs 85 crore (approx) at the domestic front alone, she also went on to bag the National Award for Best Actress.
Despite the absence of an A-List male lead, the film became one of India’s highest earning A-certified film.
For years we've had men reigning supreme in Bollywood.
From Kishore Kumar to Shammi Kapoor to Shah Rukh Khan, we've seen many kings; the simple reason might be Bollywood's fascination with glorifying the male heroism.
Given that our stories almost always revolve around the male lead, it is difficult to argue the assumption that a film's success rides on the back of the actor and gender disparity merely becomes an unavoidable by-product.
But times are changing now and the female brigade of Bollywood is ready to fight its own battles.
From Vidya Balan to Kangana Ranaut to Deepika Padukone, there have some actresses who tasted success at their own merit and made a mark.

But times are changing now and the female brigade of Bollywood is ready to fight its own battles.
From Vidya Balan to Kangana Ranaut to Deepika Padukone, there have some actresses who tasted success at their own merit and made a mark.
Here’s taking a look at some films which needed no men to be super hits...
/5-times-actresses-proved-they-needed-no-men-to-make-a-hit/Queen/eventshow/52108835.cmsWe know that ‘Queen’ was a game-changer for Kangana; the film that turned tables around for the actress and marked her entry into the “Top Actors” club.
However, what’s more interesting is that the film was off to an extremely slow start and was even termed a flop before it touched the heights.
No A-listers, no extensive promotions, no nothing.
The film tasted success on the basis of merit alone.
Not only did the film become a game-changer for Kangana, it also earned her the title of Bollywood’s Queen, making her an inspiration for every woman carving her way in a man’s world.
/5-times-actresses-proved-they-needed-no-men-to-make-a-hit/Piku/eventshow/52108833.cmsIt takes a lot of skill and mettle to make your presence felt when you’re sharing screen space with a star as huge as Amitabh Bachchan and another as talented as Irrfan Khan, let alone stealing the show altogether.
Through and through a Deepika film, ‘Piku’, not only set cash registers jingling at the box office but also bagged several critic awards.
Clearly Deepika needed no hero to take her film forward.

While her popularity was never a secret, with ‘Mary Kom’, Pee Cee took success to a whole new level.
From getting the look bang on to living the character body and soul, Priyanka received much appreciation for her biopic on boxing champion, Mary Kom.
Needless to say the film was an instant hit.
/5-times-actresses-proved-they-needed-no-men-to-make-a-hit/Mardaani/eventshow/52108827.cmsTo all those who were dubious about Rani’s comeback, the actress had the most perfect reply… ‘Mardaani’!
It is no news to anyone that Rani is an outstanding actress and with her power-packed performance in ‘Mardaani’, the actress only reaffirmed our belief in her.
He film received rave reviews from critic and audiences alike and performed pretty well at the box office too.
