There’s a brand new way to get to Sesame Street : On the Sesame Studios YouTube channel!
Beloved Sesame Street character Big Bird took the stage at YouTube’s BrandCast presentations on Thursday to announce that the long-running childrens show will be launching an all-new YouTube channel, dedication to native content specifically designed for the digital platform.
Sesame Studios will build on the success of the Sesame Street YouTube channel , which currently has over two million subscribers and nearly three billion views.
The new channel will showcase new Sesame characters, short form series, original stories and YouTube stars like Todrick Hall -- who lent his talents to create a new theme song for the channel, which ET exclusively debuts.
“ Sesame Street was the original disrupter in kids’ media,” said Steve Youngwood, Chief Operating Officer of Sesame Workshop.
“When Sesame Street began, [creator] Joan Ganz Cooney said, ‘It’s not whether kids are learning from television, but what they are learning.’ The same is true today with preschoolers and YouTube Kids.
We are a creative workshop with a 45 year history of breaking new ground.
Sesame Studios represents another new frontier for us; one where we can bring our educational expertise to an emerging platform for our audiences.”
Sesame Studios will be featured on the YouTube Kids app , which has exceeded over 10 billion views in the last year.
Ellen DeGeneres also recently launched a new playlist on the app to showcase her favorite Kids of YouTube, from singers to dancers to “the smartest of smarties.”
