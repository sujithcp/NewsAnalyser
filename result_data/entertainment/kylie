Presented By &
Just hours after news of Kylie Jenner and Tyga 's split was revealed , the rapper was in New York City to promote his upcoming clothing line collaboration with Marcelo Burlon for a Saks Fifth Avenue capsule collection.
E!
News caught up with Kylie's ex to see how he's been doing since the breakup and he admitted, "I'm good, you know?
Just another day and working hard and trying to get to that next level and achieve big things and evolve."
Tyga added that he's definitely working on designing his own line eventually, but added that he "won't put a timeline on it."
But when it comes to his breakup with Kylie, an insider previously told E!
News that "it was a long time coming."
Our insider added that the couple's relationship drama "takes its toll."
Meanwhile, a second source explained to us that "their relationship is complicated."
The reality star began dating the "Rack City" rapper in October 2014, though it has been a rocky romantic road for the duo.
On Tyga's 26th birthday in November 2015, the pair surprisingly split .
Now, with the news of their second split, sister Khloe Kardashian 's remarks to E!
seem to be truer than ever.

"I ask Kylie...'I think you were just somewhere for New Year's with him' and then like one day, they're not together," Khloe told E!
News' Catt Sadler exclusively earlier this year.
"That's the life of an 18-year-old...So I stopped asking her, because it's confusing and I hate telling people, 'Oh, they broke up' and then all of a sudden, someone pulls in my driveway and I'm like, 'Oh, s--t, I thought we were done with this one.'"
"I'm just as confused!"
Khloe added, joking, "I need like a 'Note to selfâ€”who is everybody dating in this family.'"
