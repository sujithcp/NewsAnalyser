Kylie Jenner may be the voice of her generation, but it doesn't seem like she's The Voice of it...
The reality star made her singing debut on Lil Yachty's NSFW track, "Beautiful Day," which features an ad-libbing Kylie and a whole lotta autotune.
Listen below.
Kylie's part starts at 2:40 (Warning: song uses explicit language.)
Even without Kylie, the track still comes off as a little awkward.
However, the 18-year-old businesswoman was clearly feeling it, as she snapped herself jamming out to the beat.
To be fair, Kylie has revealed before that a career in music is not necessarily something she's actually pursuing.
“No… I don’t know,” Kylie told ET's Katie Krause last June when asked if she would like to pursue a singing career at any point over the next 10 years.
”I like to keep all that to myself but I am really excited I'm coming out with... a new website this summer.”
