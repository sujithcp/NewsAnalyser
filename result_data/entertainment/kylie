Kylie Jenner didn't leave her first Met Gala unscathed.
The 18-year-old reality star posted to Snapchat on Monday night that the heavily-beaded, floor-length Balmain gown she wore to the Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology Costume Institute Gala in New York City left her all scratched up.
She paired the gown with Aquazurra shoes that also left her slightly injured.
"When your dress made you bleed and your feet are purple," Kylie captioned a pic of her scratches and bruises.
"It was worth it though," she added in a selfie showing her hair and makeup.
Kylie did make an outfit change to something a little lighter before hitting the after parties.
The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star arrived to Balmain and Olivier Rousteing after the Met Gala Celebration event wearing a futuristic mini-dress and suede, thigh-high boots.
The Met Gala was a family affair for the Kardashian-Jenner clan.
Kylie's mother, Kris Jenner, was also in attendance, along with her sisters, Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner , her brother-in-law, Kanye West, and her boyfriend, Tyga.
