The Kardashian family is at it again!
The first family of reality TV have set their sights on Cuba, months after a travel ban to the country was lifted.
Landing in Havana on Wednesday, Kourtney, Kim and Khloe made the trip a family affair, including Kanye and Kim’s 2-year-old daughter North, as well as Kourtney’s 6-year-old son Mason in the foreign festivities.
Kris, Kylie and Kendall appear to be laying low stateside.
So far, Khloe has been the only one kind enough to share snaps from the trip on social media.
“Pablo was here!
Cuba,” Khloe posted to her Instagram soon after their arrival, along with cigar selfies with sisters Kourtney and Kim, and bestie Malika Haqq.

The family is rumored to be filming scenes in Cuba for the upcoming 13th season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians , making the country the latest in a series of travel episodes on the show, following epic vacations in Greece, Thailand, Bora Bora and the Dominican Republic.
The getaway was a much-needed trip after Monday night’s Met Gala festivities -- Kris, Kim, Kanye , Kendall and Kylie went all out for the star-studded ball -- and the family appears to be taking a nice break from the madness to kick up their heels—literally!
For now, we’ll just have to wait for more pics from the Kardashian clan, from what is sure to be an unbelievable adventure.
Cuba, get ready for the Kardashians to take over!
