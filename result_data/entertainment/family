The art, which arrives with voters this week, features Peter Griffin drawn to resemble the presumptive GOP nominee.
Peter Griffin is looking awfully tan in Family Guy 's Emmy campaign.
Not a show to simply throw a DVD in the mail with some key art, the Seth MacFarlane-created cartoon is again courting controversy with this year's pitch to voters â€” with its title character drawn with the swooping hairdo and copper pigmentation of Donald J. Trump.
"As long as we're voting for dumb loudmouths, can I get an Emmy?," reads the caption, which accompanies an obligatory "for your consideration" plea in the outstanding animated program category.
It's an Emmy category that Family Guy has never won and hasn't seen itself as a nominee since 2006.
And it's not for a lack of exposure.
Family Guy 's Emmy mailers have generally raised eyebrows, particularly in 2012, when it infamously referred to voters as "overprivileged Brentwood Jews."
Trump has been the butt of Family Guy jokes in the past, though he hasn't figured prominently into the Fox cartoon yet this season.
Other series have not shied away from the divisive mogul since he announced his candidacy last year.
Both South Park and The Carmichael Show have made him the subject of episodes.
The mailer comes at an especially opportune time for Family Guy , with Trump all but locking up the GOP nomination after Tuesday's Indiana primary.
His victory there was followed by the swift retreats of Ted Cruz and John Kasich, leaving Trump the lone Republican in the presidential race.
The first round of Emmy voting starts June 13.
