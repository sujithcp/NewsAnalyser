It’s official!
Years after they were first rumored to be dating, Chloe Grace Moretz has finally confirmed her relationship with Brooklyn Beckham.
"I think the more I don't make it mysterious the more people don't care, so yes we're in a relationship," the 19-year-old actress confirmed on Watch What Happens Live on Monday night.
The pair were first rumored to be dating in the summer of 2014 and since then have been spotted out together numerous times.
In April they took their first sweet selfie standing side-by-side with Brooklyn’s arm around his lady love.
So what does the Neighbors 2 star think of her man’s famous parents – David and Victoria Beckham?
“He's a great dad, she's a great mother.
They genuinely are very good parents that's what matters most,” she said, adding, “They made a pretty son."
Clearly the proud parents agree.
Just last week, the fashion designer took her eldest son to London’s National Portrait Gallery, posing in front of a photo of herself taken while she was pregnant with Brooklyn.
“This Juergen Teller shot of myself and David brings back memories!!
I was pregnant with Brooklyn!!!
I love u@brooklynbeckham @davidbeckham,” she captioned the pic.
