Eddie Murphy has become a father for a ninth time after his girlfriend gave birth to baby girl.
Izzy Oona Murphy was born on Tuesday morning, the actor's publicist said in a statement.
She is the first child for the 55-year-old comic with his 36-year-old girlfriend Paige Butcher.
"Both mother and daughter are doing well," Arnold Robinson said in a statement.
Murphy has eight other children, including five with ex-wife Nicole Mitchell, who was married to the Hollywood star from 1993 to 2006.
Murphy was honoured last year with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor for his work in film and stand-up.
He is expected to reprise his role as Axel Foley for a fourth instalment of Beverly Hills Cop, but a date for the proposed project has not been set.
