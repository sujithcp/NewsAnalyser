Gwen Stefani and James Corden Sing Carpool Karaoke With Surprise Guests George Clooney and Julia Roberts
Presented By &
Gwen Stefani joined James Corden in the passenger seat for a round of Carpool Karaoke on last night's Late Late Show , and it was a truly magical experience.
They got down to some of Gwen's new hits, some old hits, some No Doubt favorites, and of course, discussed her adorable relationship with Voice costar Blake Shelton .
Singalongs included Gwen's's "Used to Love You," "Sweet Escape" and "Rich Girl," plus No Doubt's "Don't Speak."
At one point, James complimented the 46-year-old singer's appearance.
"I feel like you are like Benjamin Button.
You are not aging.
I feel like you're getting younger.
You are just ageless.
My wife is going, 'I just want to know what she does.
What's her regime?'
I feel like I've in the past year about 10 years," he said.
Referring to her split from husband Gavin Rossdale , Gwen replied, "What happened was my life blew up.
After that I kind of started falling in love.
Then I wrote a whole record about that.
That's like what the facelift is, I think!"
The late-night host needed two more people in order to drive in the carpool lane, so he picked up an A-list actor: GeorgeClooney .
"You owe me big time for this," he said after hopping in the backseat.
He then called his Money Monster co-star JuliaRoberts and asked her to join their musical on wheels.
Together, the four stars sang Gwen's "Hollaback Girl" and Queen 's "We Are the Champions."
The Late Late Show with James Corden airs weeknights at 12:35 a.m.
