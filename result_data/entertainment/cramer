In the mid 1980s, Joey Cramer was a preteen Disney star, with a lead role in 1986's Flight of the Navigator .
He also appeared in TV movies and two episodes of Murder She Wrote before leaving acting.
Now, Cramer is getting a different kind of attention.
The 42-year-old has been arrested and charged with robbing a Scotiabank in British Columbia.
According to the RCMP, Cramer was wearing a shoulder-length wig, bandana, and dark jacket when he allegedly robbed the bank of an undisclosed amount of cash.
"Despite the fact that a disguise was used during the robbery, the suspect was quickly identified by some of our officers, who had recently dealt with him on an unrelated matter," RCMP Constable Harrison Mohr told The Coast Reporter .
"We hope that the community feels safer now that the suspect has been apprehended."
Cramer was arrested on Sunday and charged with robbery, disguise with the intent to commit an indictable offense.
He was also charged with failing to stop for a peace officer and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle.
Constable Mohr tells the CBC that it's unclear whether Cramer used a weapon.
It's not the first time that the actor has had legal trouble.
In 2011, the RCMP asked the public to help find Cramer when he was wanted for allegedly "altering the name and/or the amount of cheques before cashing them at local financial institutions."
He was later convicted for using a forged document and given a six-month sentence, and 18 months probation, the National Post reports.
Cramer remains in custody.
It's unclear whether he has hired an attorney.
