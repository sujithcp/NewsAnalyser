| TNN | May 9, 2016, 01.03 AM ISTMUMBAI: The parents of television actor Pratyusha Banerjee submitted a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh to entrust the probe into her death to the "most premier investigation agency'' in the country to ensure justice for their daughter.
"Her death is a murder, which is being shown as a case of suicide," the parents told Singh when they handed over the letter personally on Sunday.
In a two-page letter written in Hindi, Soma Banerjee stated that her daughter has been "shown as having committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan in a room, which had no tables to even climb on".
Both parents—Shankar and Soma—told TOI that the minister assured them that he would look into the issue.
They said they have not named any agency as they did not wish to upset the probe that was being carried out by the Mumbai police right now.
The letter mentioned that Pratyusha (24) came in contact with Rahul Raj Singh last June who within days "entrapped her in his love game".
"On the pretext of celebrating her birthday last August, Rahul demanded Rs 2 lakh from us and has been harassing her mentally and physically and reduced her bank balance to zero a day before her murder," the letter stated.
The letter alleged that though she (Soma) had informed the police about possible foul play into the death, since she was not familiar with Marathi, the language of the first information report, she was unaware that the police had registered it merely as a case of suicide on April 1.
It stated that despite adequate material with the police in the form of call data records, witness statements and site panchanama and their own case that Rahul consumed drugs, the police have failed to register it as a murder case.Recommended By Colombia
