Flies there to be with girlfriend Disha Patani
Tiger Shroff and model-actress Disha Patani are said to be dating each other.
Recently, the young actor had hinted in an interview that he and Disha had gone their separate ways but that is far from the truth.
Tiger will fly to China to spend some quality time with Disha.
Says a source, “Tiger and Disha have been going steady for a couple of years now.
The two love-birds have been often spotted in Bandra and Andheri at restaurants or movie theatres catching up on some couple time.
But as both have been very busy with their films — he with Baaghi and she with MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Yoga , they have hardly been able to spend time together.
Of course, they have made sure they are together with a friend, so its a threesome, and speculations don't get confirmed about their romance.
But now, their romance seems to be heating up.
Next week, Tiger plans to fly to China to meet Disha where she is shooting for Chan's film.
Of course, the trip may be termed as work, but the couple's plans are privy to only a select few.”
The source adds, “Tiger's not an outgoing person.
Yet, the couple make an effort to make time for each other whenever they can.”
