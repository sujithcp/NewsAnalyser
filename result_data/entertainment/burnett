Even a seasoned show runner like Mark Burnett couldn’t have scripted a love story as perfect as Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's.
The Voice showrunner spoke to ET's Deidre Behar about his stars’ blossoming romance, which all started on his hit NBC competition series.
“It's great for us.
We love them,” Burnett told ET of the judges.
“I consider both Blake and Gwen separately to be very close friends, and both of them went through a lot.”
Both artists were filming the show shortly after their splits from former spouses Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale (who had each appeared as mentors on the show at one point).
Fresh off their breakups, Shelton and Stefani found love with each other.
“I was there in those dark moments because we were working together at the time, it was their private lives but it spills over,” Burnett recalled, getting visibly emotional.
“And then I said to Blake and Gwen, ‘Imagine in your darkest moments if someone showed you a videotape of right now, the love you have, wouldn't it be great?’ And they're both smiling.
It would be great.
They are so amazing, they're amazing.”
But don’t expect Burnett to take credit for the lovebird’s new relationship.
“Not at all,“ he said.
“This is life, they happened to bump into each other, which is great.”
The couple debuted their first duet, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on Monday night, singing while gazing longingly into each other’s eyes.
