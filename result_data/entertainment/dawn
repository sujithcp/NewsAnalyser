Hank Steinberg and 'Black Hawk Down's' Ken Nolan will oversee 'Dawn,' from MGM TV.
Hulu is ready to turn its lens on prehistoric times.
The streaming service has handed out a pilot order to Dawn, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
Dawn, from Without a Trace creator Hank Steinberg and Black Hawk Down 's Ken Nolan, is described as an epic drama set in prehistoric times.
It follows a tribe of Neanderthals as they struggle to survive and hold on to their own way of life after coming into contact with a family of Homo Sapiens.
At the intersection of evolution and genocide, Dawn asks the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human?
A co-production between MGM and Hulu, Steinberg and Nolan created the drama and will exec produce.
Robert Stromberg ( Maleficent, Avatar, Alice in Wonderland ) will direct the pilot.
Production is scheduled to begin May 9 in Ireland.
The potential series will be made up of an international cast, with Fola Evans Akingbola, Temuera Morrison, Carl Shaaban and Matthew Hopkinson in final negotiations to star.
The pilot order for Hulu comes a day after its presentation to Madison Avenue at the Newfronts, where the streamer renewed The Mindy Project and drama The Path for additional seasons.
Dawn joins a pilot roster at the company that also includes comedy Future Man as well as dramas When the Street Lights Go On and Citizen .
Should Dawn go to series, it would also join Shut Eye, Chance and newly ordered The Handmaid's Tale .
For MGM, Dawn is the company's second project at Hulu and joins straight-to-series drama Handmaid's Tale.
Steinberg is repped by WME, 3 Arts and Gendler & Kelly; Nolan is with CAA and Kaplan/Perrone; Stromberg is also with WME.
