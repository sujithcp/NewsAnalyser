Paris Jackson’s got some new bling!
Michael Jackson’s 18-year-old daughter has been on a body modification kick as of late, showing off new tattoos and piercings on her Instagram account.
On Wednesday, Paris showed off her latest addition: a tongue ring.
“Almost like ring-toss.
but with noodles and needles,” the King of Pop’s only daughter captioned the pic of her looping a ring of pasta around her tongue stud.
Paris went to celebrity body piercer Chris Saint at Timeless Tattoo & Body Piercing in Los Angeles for the tongue piercing.
Paris marked her recent 18th birthday by getting a tattoo tribute to her late father, who died in 2009, inking “Queen of My Heart” in her father’s handwriting on her wrist.
"To everyone else he was the King of Pop.
To me, well, he was the king of my heart," she captioned the sweet, black-and-white Instagram.
