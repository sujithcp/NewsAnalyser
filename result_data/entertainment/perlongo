And Max from Catfish is going to be like, a fun uncle, probably!
Nev Schulman and his girlfriend, Laura Perlongo, are expecting their first child, she announced on ATTN , revealing the MTV reality star had gotten her pregnant "accidentally on purpose."
"To be fair it wasn’t a complete accident," Perlongo wrote.
"We had talked about wanting kids and had pulled the goalie maybe half-a-time-once but weren’t necessarily expecting this news, THE NEWS."
Even more exciting news: It's a girl!
Schulman, 31, announced as much on Instagram, alongside a picture of him kissing his smiling girlfriend on the forehead.
"No words can capture the excitement and joy I feel about becoming a father," he captioned the picture.
Perlongo, a 30-year-old freelance advertising creative, shared her own Instagram and joked, "I ate a big sandwich and it has a heartbeat!
Completely head over heels in love."
She added, "SO EXCITED FOR THIS BABYYYY!!!"
The couple has been dating "long-distance [for] 7 months (with a break in August)," Perlongo says, but concludes her announcement, "Nev and I certainly have no idea what we’re doing, we just know we’re doing something we want to be doing.
Hopefully we don’t suck at it or turn into know-it-all zombies.
Mainly we're just really happy and excited."
Catfish co-host Max Joseph recently revealed he was cyberstalked and tricked into believing his wife was help hostage.
