Mick Jagger and his bandmates have asked Donald Trump’s campaign bosses to stop using their music at his campaign events.
Trump practically clinched the Republican Party’s U.S. Presidential candidate nomination by winning the Indiana primary and marched out for his victory speech to the Rolling Stones’ 1981 hit “Start Me Up”, reported Guardian online.
The band members clearly weren’t happy and have instructed legal team to stop Trump’s camp from using Stones hits.
“The Rolling Stones have never given permission to the Trump campaign to use their songs,” a spokesman said.
“They have requested that they cease all use immediately.”
It’s not the first time the property tycoon-turned-presidential wannabe has used Stones songs as campaign music; previous rallies have featured tunes “like You Can’t Always Get What You Want” and “Brown Sugar”.
Following Trump’s victory on May 3, his opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropped out of the race for the White House, making the businessman the overwhelming favourite to win the 2016 GOP Presidential nomination.
Here is “Start Me Up” by Rolling Stones:
