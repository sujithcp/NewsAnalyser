Live television is fraught with peril, including the occasional wardrobe malfunction -- which is exactly what happened on Mondayâ€™s Dancing With the Stars .
Pro dancer Sharna Burgess , decked out in a super sexy black bustier under a sheer, black lace top, suffered a bit of a nip slip while performing with her partner, NFL star Antonio Brown.
Burgess and Brown were cutting up the dance floor with a passionate tango set to a cover of The Rolling Stones' "Paint It Black," when the incident occurred.
As they danced, Burgess' bustier continued to slip down, and the dancer was totally oblivious to it.
Toward the end of the dance, Brown spun Burgess around, revealing the wardrobe malfunction, but the cameras quickly (and awkwardly) cut to a shot of the DWTS logo toward the back of the stage for a few moments until the dance ended.
However, no one seemed to warn Burgess about the mishap between the end of the dance and the start of the judges' feedback, because her chest was still clearly visible as she stood and spoke with the judges.
It was host Tom Bergeron who finally gave Burgess a heads up after getting word from backstage that her top had slid down.
He told her she might want to "pull it up, just a touch" as he tried to shield the dancer from the camera.

Burgess seemed shocked and embarrassed for a moment, but the seasoned pro quickly joked about the mishap, saying that her nip slip meant the dance should earn them some perfect scores from the judges .
In the end, the dance didn't get them three 10s, but they did walk away with a formidable score of 24.
