Amber Rose is getting her own talk show!
The weekly series, which is set to debut this summer on VH1, is being produced by Dr. Phil and will allow the 32-year-old "feminist, author, actor and entrepreneur" to bring her "unique style, hustle and hilarious point of view" to TV.
"I am very excited to be joining forces with such an amazing network to deliver a fresh perspective on the primetime talk show," Rose said in a statement.
"Join us as we break all the rules and redefine late-night.
Watch out Fallon, here comes MUVA!"
According to the network's press release, Rose will conduct "candid interviews with celebrity friends" with topics ranging from pop culture, race and motherhood, to relationships, friendships and entrepreneurship.
"Uhh Ohh," Rose wrote to her 10.8 million followers on Instagram .
"Muva has a Talk Show on @vh1 Produced by @DrPhil I finally have a voice & ur gonna love what I have 2 say."
According to VH1 General Manager Chris McCarthy , Rose's talk show -- which is still unnamed -- is a perfect fit for the network.
"A true multi-hyphenate, she is a devoted mother, a strong advocate for women's rights and a celebrated author all of which make her an ideal host," McCarthy said.
"Amber is a perfect addition to the VH1 family because our audience is interested in hearing unique perspectives from those who are unapologetically themselves and not afraid to take a stand on issues they are passionate about."
Do you think Amber Rose's talk show will last longer than Khloe Kardashian's canceled FYI series, Kocktails With Khloe ?
