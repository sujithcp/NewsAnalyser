Baby mama’s birthday!
Blac Chyna celebrated her 28th birthday on Tuesday night at the Hard Rock Café in Hollywood.
The party was thrown for both Chyna’s birthday and the launch of her new Chymoji app.
The pregnant TV personality and model was joined by her fiancé Rob Kardashian on the red carpet at the event where she wore black pants with a draped black top.
Though she tried to hide it, her growing baby bump was just visible underneath her flowy top.

In her hair, Chyna wore silver metal rings, looped into her braid.
Rob wore an all-black ensemble with a New York Yankees cap.
After the event, the 29-year-old star showered his future bride with birthday gifts.

“OMG look at how pretty this cake is,” she squealed.
