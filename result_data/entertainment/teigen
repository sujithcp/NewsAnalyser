John Legend just won major brownie points.
The "All of Me" singer took to Twitter on Tuesday to stick up for his wife, Chrissy Teigen, who frequently finds herself firing back at haters over social media.
Late last month, many people appeared to be extremely bothered when the new parents stepped out for a date night at The Nice Guy in West Hollywood, California, leaving their newborn baby , Luna, home just two weeks after her birth.
Unfortunately, the 30-year-old model was on the receiving end of all the negative comments.
"Funny there's no dad-shaming," Legend, 37, tweeted.
"When both of us go out to dinner, shame both of us so Chrissy doesn't have to take it all.
We'll split it."
Fans of the couple were ecstatic about the loving husband's tweet, writing things like, "That's why you're the realest!
Standing up for your wife, true love," "Please marry me too," and "relationship goals yet again."
At the time, Teigen voiced her opinions on the "passive aggressive" messages she received, sharing screenshots of some of the hateful comments left on her various social media accounts.
"I went to dinner.
People are p**sed.
Good morning!"
Teigen tweeted the day after their outing.
Despite the constant backlash, Teigen hasn't been shy about what she chooses to post on social media.
On Tuesday, the brunette beauty got all glammed up for a photo shoot and proved she's a multitasking expert by playing double-duty as mom and model.
As seen in an adorable video posted to her Snapchat, Teigen breastfed Luna while a friend helped adjust her top in preparation for the shoot.
"Christine wears many hats," the text on the video read.
