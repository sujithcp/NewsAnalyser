Kylie Jenner took Kanye West's already creepy (though very on theme), blue contacts Met Gala look and took it one step further by putting it through Snapchatâ€™s most dangerous filter by far, Faceswap.
"Look I'm Kanye," she captioned the snap.
The rapper and fashion designer showed up to the tech-themed fashion event in torn blue jeans, a bedazzled Balmain jean jacket and the aforementioned pale blue contacts, while his wife Kim Kardashian went with a long-sleeved silver-paneled Balmain dress with a high slit.
