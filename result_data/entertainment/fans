Fans left tributes to Norman Goldie at the groundAberdeen have 'retired' the seat of a colourful fan, following his death after suffering a stroke.
Norman Goldie, 87, was known by fans and the club for his passionate support and wearing sandals with one red and one white sock - the team's colours.
His seat in the Merkland Stand has been painted half red and half white, to mark his famous socks.
"As long as the Dons remain at Pittodrie, that seat will never be sold," the club said.
Clubs often retire the shirt number of former stars who pass on, but it is uncommon for fans to be honoured in this way.
Flowers and football scarves have been laid outside Pittodrie by fans paying their respects to Norman, who died on 3 May.
