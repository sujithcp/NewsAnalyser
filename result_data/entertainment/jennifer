The Kentucky Derby was held on Saturday at the Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where local race fans mingled with the Hollywood elite.
Nyquist, the horse named after the Detroit Red Wings player Gustav Nyquist, won the 142nd Kentucky Derby, but the day of mint juleps and traditionally elaborate (but lucky) hats was honored both in person and on social media throughout the day.
See how Hollywood celebrated the annual event.
