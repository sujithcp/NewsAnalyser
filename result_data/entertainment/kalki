According to a report on Spotboye.com, the National Award winning actress was groped outside the awards ceremony venue.
The report states that after the ceremony was wrapped up, Kalki headed towards her car.
However, the security personnel escorting her strangely moved ahead to escort Amitabh Bachchan and Kangana Ranaut, leaving Kalki stranded.
The next thing Kalki knew, she was being mobbed and with no security to help her, things turned worse and the actress was allegedly groped.
The report further states that an enraged Kalki then managed to break free and hurried inside.
She even contemplated filing a police complaint, but then decided against it and complained to the organisers instead.
