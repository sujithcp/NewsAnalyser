Gallery: Jungle Book Film CGI Special Effects By MPC
The lazy river sequence was one of the most complicated scenes for MPCâ€™s team to create in the movie, with environments, water effects, fur, character animation and the live action Mowgli all needing to blend together with complex interaction between CG and live action elements
Cutting-edge techniques used to create the world of The Jungle Book on an LA sound stage have been revealed in new behind-the-scenes photos.
More than 800 computer-graphics artists created the lush jungle of India without the need for any location filming, and brought to life iconic characters like Baloo, Bagheera and Shere Khan.
To make things as life-like as possible, new computer programmes were created to better simulate muscles, skin and fur.
More than 100,000 photos of real locations in the Indian jungle were also taken to help computer designers recreate the landscape in minute detail.
The 'lazy river' scene was filmed in a pool... which became a jungle river
The newly-released photos show Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, in a swimming pool filming the 'lazy river' scene where he rides on Baloo's stomach.
Another shows a wolf puppet, filmed against a blue screen, being used for Sethi to act with - before later being replaced by a CGI version.
The Disney movie - released last month - features voices from Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba and Scarlett Johansson and is currently second at the UK box office.
