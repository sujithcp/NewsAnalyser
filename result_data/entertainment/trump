The Donald Trump taco bowl fiasco just took a turn.
The presumptive Republican nominee for president drew a lot of backlash (mostly in the form of groans and facepalms) when he tweeted out a photo of himself eating a taco from Trump Cafe, writing, "Happy #CincoDeMayo!
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.
I love Hispanics!"
The tweet was made fun of on Twitter for seeming insincere, culturally reductive, and for apparently incorrectly identifying the meal as coming from Trump Tower Grill (which reportedly doesn't serve taco bowls).
But Independent Journal creative director Benny Johnson also noticed that Trump was enjoying his meal on top of a bikini-clad photo of his ex wife, Marla Maples.
While it was later revealed that the picture was very likely from a recent edition of People (meaning he didn't just have it lying around), we can probably all agree that the Internet has probably had just about enough fun from this one, ridiculous tweet.
Maples -- who was married to Trump from 1993-99 -- spoke to ET exclusively in March after the Republican candidate sent out a misogynistic attack against Ted Cruz's wife.
"I believe the world is just a better place when we can keep the peace," Maples said at the time.
"We're all different, but we're all alike in a lot of ways."
Maples is competing on season 22 of Dancing With the Stars , and also opened up to ET about how her ex-husband reacted to her appearing on the show.
"He wished me the best of luck, absolutely, and I so appreciate it.
It was fantastic," Maples said.
"So many friends and family are reaching out.
It means so much."
