Fallon introduced his new "country-music duo" on Friday's 'Tonight Show.'
Friday's Tonight Show saw the television debut of Jimmy Fallon and Keith Urban's band, FML.
Fallon introduced his "country-music duo" in the context of the website FML.com, where users tell stories ending in "FML" (fâ€” my life), explaining that he and Urban sing about the very same topic.
"That's interesting because I'm actually in a country-music duo, and our band name is FML," Fallon told the audience.
So Urban and Fallon, adopting a Southern accent, took the stage with a guitar and a banjo to sing some country songs inspired by the website.
One verse began, "Today I heard water dripping from the back of our house.
I went to investigate, only to find a man peeing on our garden gnome.
FML."
But perhaps Fallon's favorite was "Today my boss fired me via text message.
I don't have a text-message plan.
So basically I paid 25 cents to get fired.
FML."
