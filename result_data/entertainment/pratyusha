Instead of resolving, the mystery around Pratyusha Banerjee’s death is getting darker as a blame game rages between her parents and boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh.
While her parents have written to home minister Rajnath Singh seeking a probe into her death by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Rahul claimed on Saturday that the parents of the 24-year-old actress used to mentally torture her.
Rahul has also issued a defamation notice to Neeraj Gupta, who had claimed to be his lawyer when he was admitted to the Shri Sai Hospital after Pratyusha’s death.
On April 1, Pratyusha, who shot to fame for her role as Anandi in Balika Vadhu, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself inside her flat in suburban Goregaon.
Two days later, a case under IPC sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 504, 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) was registered against Rahul based on a complaint lodged by the actress’s parents.
Rahul claimed in an interview to Times of India , “He (Neeraj) has tarnished my image.
He accused me of pushing Pratyusha into drugs, hitting her and siphoning money from her.
He also accused me of having no source of income and being a fraud.
He was never my lawyer but a self-appointed one.
It’s his moral duty to not talk about his client in the media.
Some others also accused me, saying they wanted to know the truth... but now, I am fighting back to know the truth.
Where are they now?”
He also said he will file defamation cases against actress Kamya Punjabi, producer Vikas Gupta and common friend Leena Dias.
Rahul said in the interview, “Kamya owes Pratyusha Rs 2.5 lakh.
Pratyusha had even messaged her once asking for the money.
Vikas claimed that he had a video of me slapping Pratyusha.
I demand to see it.”
