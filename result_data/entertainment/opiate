“I too, waited anxiously for a prescription to be filled for the opiate I was secretly addicted to,” the actress, 57, wrote in an essay for the Huffington Post.
“I too, took too many at once.
I too, sought to kill emotional and physical pain with painkillers.
Kill it.
Make it stop.”
According to the “Scream Queens” star, her struggle began after she was prescribed painkillers following a medical procedure.
Fortunately for her, she has been clean for nearly two decades.
“I am one of the lucky ones as I have been in recovery from opiate addiction for over 17 years,” she wrote.
While the actress is glad that the government is finally joining the fight against opiate addiction, she wrote that she still mourns those for whom this was too late.
“I, like all of you, mourn the passing of a great artist but I also mourn the passing of potential artists past and present, caught in this deadly vise.”
