Rob Lowe might have just had his show, The Grinder , canceled, but he's keeping his eye on the silver lining.
" The Grinder was not renewed by @FOXTV," Lowe tweeted Thursday.
"It was unapologetically original, smart, funny and had a murder's row of talent.
#GrinderRests."
The Grinder , also starring Fred Savage, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, William Devane, Natalie Morales and Steve Little, launched to modest ratings but went on to enjoy widespread acclaim.
"The great news is that film is forever," Lowe continued.
"And I'm thrilled to have 22 episodes that were as acclaimed as they were.
Time well spent!"
Lowe summed up his series of tweets with a joke playing off the show's title.
"And there is still Grindr," he wrote, referencing the gay social network app.
"So there's that.
#NotAllBadNews."
Fox canned the comedy series after just one season.
Along with The Grinder , Fox also axed Grandfathered , Bordertown and Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life .
