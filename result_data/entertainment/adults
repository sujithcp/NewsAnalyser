'Empire' leads Wednesday with a reasonably steady showing.
Wednesday brought a few ratings spills, but the night's dominant telecast, Empire , was mostly in line with last week's showing.
The drama averaged a 3.6 rating among adults 18-49 for Fox, steady with last week's initial score and off two-tenths of a point from its final adjustment.
Rosewood (1.2 adults) also held up.
Survivor brought an even 2.1 rating among adults 18-49 for CBS, followed by the season finale of Criminal Minds (1.8 adults) and a new episode of spinoff Beyond Borders (1.2 adults).
The ABC comedy block — The Middle (1.7 adults), The Goldbergs (1.9 adults), Modern Family (2.2 adults) and Black-ish (1.6 adults) — was also solid with last week, as was Nashville (0.9 adults).
NBC saw sharp drops for both Law & Order: SVU (1.1 adults) and Chicago P.D.
(1.2 adults).
Each was off by three-tenths of a point from last week, following a flat Heartbeat (0.7 adults).
Arrow (0.9 adults) was also down on The CW, shedding two-tenths of a point in the key demo before a steady Supernatural (0.6 adults).
