The CBS drama finds its way back to the schedule, smaller but assisting the network in a tie with NBC.
A crowded cable dial — featuring the Indiana primary and NBA/NHL playoffs — brought some fatigue to the broadcast networks on Tuesday night.
NBC and CBS shared a victory in the key demo.
The Voice , earning a series low 1.6 rating among adults 18-49, fell four-tenths of a point from last Tuesday's outing.
The rest of the NBC block was mixed with Chicago Med (1.5 adults) down three-tenths of a point but Chicago Fire (1.6 adults) holding steady.
CBS saw NCIS: New Orleans rise two-tenths of a point to a 1.8 rating among adults 18-49 after a steady outing for the parent series (1.9 adults).
At 10 o'clock, Person of Interest began its final run with a 1.2 rating in the key demo — naturally down from its last return in the fall.
On The CW, The Flash (1.2 adults) and Containment (0.5 adults) were steady with the previous week.
On ABC, Fresh Off the Boat (1.1 adults) dropped two-tenths of a point before a flat The Real O'Neals (1.0 adults).
Agents of SHIELD fetched a 0.9 adults 18-49 rating, and Beyond the Tank was flat with a 0.5 rating.
Fox saw little movement during its comedy block of New Girl (1.0 adults), Grandfathered (0.7 adults), another New Girl (0.9 adults) and The Grinder (0.5 adults).
