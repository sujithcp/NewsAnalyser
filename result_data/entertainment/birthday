It helps to have the arm that wields Thor's hammer mixing your cake.
Elsa Pataky shared a snap of husband Chris Hemsworth (and his gigantic biceps ) preparing a cake for their daughter India's upcoming 4th birthday, writing, "Papa working hard on India's birthday cake!
Happy birthday India, love you more than anything!"
Hemsworth shared a snap of the delicious-looking creation, writing, "What happens when the bakery says they don't have time to make your daughter a birthday cake?
You get involved and smash one out yourself !
I call it 'La TRex al la chocolate.'"
Watch the video below to see how working with Hemsworth is basically like working with a Ken doll.
