A still from 'Thani Oruvan'
Director Mohan Raja hopes to make the sequel to last year’s Tamil blockbuster “Thani Oruvan” as his brother Jayam Ravi’s 25th film.
During a chat with fans on Twitter on Monday, Raja,who directed the first part, revealed that he hopes to make “Thani Oruvan 2” with his brother.
When a fan asked him, “can we expect a sequel to ‘Thani Oruvan’,” Raja said: “Sure.
Ravi’s 25th film, hopefully”.
An edge-of-the-seat thriller featuring a righteous police officer and a suave, conniving entrepreneur, “Thani Oruvan” won over both audiences and critics alike.
Ravi is currently working on “Bogan”, and it happens to be his 24th film.
Meanwhile, “Thani Oruvan” is currently being remade in Telugu with Ram Charan in the lead.
