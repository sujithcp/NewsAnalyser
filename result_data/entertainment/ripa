A late-night host will be waking up early to briefly fill Michael Strahan's seat alongside Kelly Ripa after he leaves Live!
With Kelly and Michael to take a full-time position at Good Morning America.
The daytime talk show confirmed on Instagram on Tuesday that Jimmy Kimmel will be Ripa's first guest co-host on Monday, May 16, following Strahan's departure on Friday, May 13.
A source close to the show tells ET that Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper will also be guest co-hosting Live!
, as they are Ripa's friends and regulars on the ABC program.
The source adds that "no official word" has come down as to when Ripa's permanent co-host will be announced, but many feel it will be at the beginning of the new season in September.
Strahan's last day on the Emmy-winning show is less than two weeks away, but ET's source says fans should not expect "any big promotion" regarding his departure.
On Tuesday's Live!, Ripa addressed her co-host's exit for the first time since her return to the show last week .
"A week from this Friday is Michael's final show here at Live! "
she announced as the crowd booed.
One audience member yelled, "We still love you, Kelly!"
Ripa quipped back, "Thanks, I'm still here."
"We'll remember.
We'll reminisce.
We're going to look back at the fun times we've had together -- wait till you see all the stuff that we've done, you're not going to believe it," she told her co-host.
"So join us for Michael's Flashback Friday Farewell on Friday the 13th."
Laughing, Ripa added, "You can't plan this!
You literally cannot plan it."
At the Met Gala in New York City on Monday night, Strahan spoke to ET about leaving Live!
for the ABC morning show.
"I'm looking forward to [ GMA ], but I still look forward to going to work at Live!
," Strahan said.
"I love being there.
I still love it."
