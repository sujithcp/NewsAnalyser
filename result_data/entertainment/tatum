A woman has accomplished her dream of becoming the world's first autistic, non-verbal talk show host - with the help of Channing Tatum as her guest.
Carly Fleischmann has been unable to speak her entire life and was diagnosed with motor neurone apraxia as a toddler.
With the help of an iPad and keyboard, her first question was whether he would ever consider dating a 21-year-old with autism, and Tatum replied by saying he would need permission from his wife first.
Their interview ended with several kisses on the head at Carly's insistence
"Alright, I've got my lawyers working on your divorce lawyers as we speak!"
she replied, in an example of the razor-sharp wit and comedy she offered throughout the interview.
With imaginative questions few talk show hosts would think to ask, Carly managed to get Tatum to spill several secrets about his early life and breakthrough into acting.
She mentioned his days as a stripper, and candidly asked how many girls he used to take home at the end of a night's work.
"Some nights were more than others," Tatum admitted.
Carly has communicated using PCs and tablets since she was 10 years old
He also revealed the two actors he aspires to work with the most as Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.
The seven-minute interview has proven to be a roaring success on YouTube, racking up more than 300,000 views since it was first uploaded.
It ended with Tatum kissing Carly on the head - only for her to insist on a few more from the man she described as "one of the most attractive hunks in Hollywood".
