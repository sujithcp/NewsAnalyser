When it comes to writing comedy, Woody Allen likes to draw from personal experience.
So when he was asked at a Cannes Film Festival press conference Wednesday about flipping his usual romantic comedy dynamic – in which a young woman falls for a powerful older man – the director said he would not know how to write a film that way.
While he acknowledged the concept was "a perfectly valid comic idea," Allen, 80, said he lacks personal experience with the subject, according to The New York Times .
"I just don't have any material," he said on Wednesday.
"I don't have anything really to draw on.
But I wouldn't hesitate if I had a good story."
Like many of his previous films, Allen's most recent project, Café Society , tells the story of a young woman, played by Kristen Stewart , who is infatuated with an older Hollywood power player, played by Steve Carell .

In 1997, the multi-hyphenate comedian famously married Soon-Yi Previn – the adopted daughter of his former girlfriend Mia Farrow – who is 35 years his junior.
Controversy over Allen swirled on the day of his movie's premiere.
Ronan Farrow, the director's son with Mia Farrow, wrote a column in The Hollywood Reporter about his sister Dylan's allegations that Allen sexually abused her as a child.
Ronan condemned the media for not asking Allen tough questions and stars for working with Allen, comparing the situation to Bill Cosby before his public downfall.
Allen has long denied the allegations, writing in the New York Times in 2014, "Of course, I did not molest Dylan."
In 1993, a Connecticut prosecutor decided not to pursue charges against Allen because, he said, Dylan was too "fragile" for a trial.
At the Cannes opening night premiere of Allen's movie, the audience gasped, according to Variety , when the emcee, French actor Laurent Lafitte joked, "It's very nice that you've been shooting so many movies in Europe, even if you are not being convicted for rape in the U.S." It is unclear whom Lafitte was referencing, as some have pointed to Roman Polanski as the joke's intended target.
In a recent interview in Variety , Kristen Stewart said she and costar Jesse Eisenberg weighed the allegations against Allen before deciding to work with him.
"At the end of the day, Jesse and I talked about this.
If we were persecuted for the amount of s— that's been said about us that’s not true, our lives would be over," she said.
"The experience of making the movie was so outside of that, it was fruitful for the two of us to go on with it."
