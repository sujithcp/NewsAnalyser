Sorry, Drake and RiRi fans -- the two are still just friends, a source close to Rihanna tells ET.
The two superstars have certainly been close lately , with Drake making an appearance at Rihanna's latest Anti World Tour stop at the Forum in Los Angeles on Wednesday night.
Following their sexy performance of "Work," a report claimed the two have secretly been a couple for months, but our source says Drake and Rihanna are not actually dating.
"They are just friends," the source tells ET.
"They love messing around with people.
They have a great friendship and definitely play the flirty game."
Still, the chemistry between Rihanna, 28, and Drake, 29, is pretty undeniable -- and they have no problem keeping people guessing.
The "Hotline Bling" rapper recently gave their fans more hope that the two are an item, thanks to a telling lyric in his track "Hype" from his new album, Views From the 6.
"They want to be on TV right next to me," Drake raps.
"You cannot be right here next to me.
Donâ€™t you see RiRi right next to me?"
Last week, Drake talked about his relationship with Rihanna in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe .
"We do well together as a team," he said.
"I think we do great music together.
It's tough to do guy-girl collabs.
I think [the chemistry] is what makes the records better though.
It's something genuine there."
"We're not forcing some story on people," he continued.
"A lot of the music that we make and the energy that we bring is genuine.
We have a lot of genuine energy between us."
In March, Rihanna told Vogue she was single .
"My schedule is so crazy right now," she explained.
"It's definitely going to be a challenge when I do decide to pursue a relationship .

but I have hope!"
