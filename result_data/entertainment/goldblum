Jeff Goldblum is revelling in fatherhood!
During a screening for the 20th anniversary edition release of Independence Day on Tuesday, the 63-year-old actor told ET that his 10-month-old son , Charlie, recently hit a big milestone.
"We just flew back today from [Washington,] D.C. to New York, and he was on my lap the whole time," Goldblum said.
"We all went together, and he was sitting on me saying 'Dada' for the first time.
He kept saying 'Dada!'"
"I adore being a dad," he added.
"It's fantastic."
Independence Day took on even more meaning when Goldblum became a first-time father on July 4, 2015, at age 62.
In an even kookier coincidence, Charlie arrived while he was on leave from shooting the 1996 blockbuster's upcoming sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence .
The Jurassic Park star was given a one-week break from filming to fly from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, where his wife , 33-year-old actress and aerialist Emilie Livingston, was set to give birth.
"That was definitely my most memorable Independence Day," Goldblum laughed.
"Emilie's due date was [the] fourth of July, but they said it could be two weeks either side."
It seems it was only natural that Charlie would utter one of his most significant first words on the same day as the original film's re-release!
The Roland Emmerich-directed sequel will see Goldblum reunited with many of the original film's stars, including Vivicia A.
Fox, Bill Pullman and Judd Hirsch.
In fact, Goldblum said it was a "no brainer" to revive his old role as satellite technician David Levinson and admitted that it was surreal and humbling to be back on set two decades later.
"I was thinking, 'Geez, look at these sets -- this is bigger than anything we had last time!
What a thrill.
Thank you heavenly stars for causing all of this to happen.
I'm grateful to Roland and the entire universe,'" he told ET.
"That was my feeling."
Independence Day: Resurgence his theaters June 24.
