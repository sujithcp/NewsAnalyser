Karlie Kloss went a little DIY with her Met Gala after-party look.
The 23-year-old model doubled up her styles at the Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age Of Technology Costume Institute Gala on Monday night in New York City.
She first stepped out in a white Brandon Maxwell coat, but later stripped that off to reveal a matching cutout gown by the same designer.
She paired the look with Giuseppe Zanotti heels and a Repossi staple, pink gold earring that was fully set with diamonds.

Once the Met Gala was over, out came the scissors, and Kloss' floor-length gown became a mini-dress.
"This is a bad idea," she exclaims in an Instagram video as her gown gets cut shorter while she's wearing it.
"Or maybe it's brilliant, I don't know!"
Despite her initial fears, Kloss seemed quite pleased with how her after-party style turned out, posing fiercely in her new, leggy look.
She also caught up with her model friends, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid.
