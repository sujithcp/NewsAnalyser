Justin Bieber now has the Where's Waldo?
of tattoos.
The 22-year-old singer added a tiny cross to his massive body art collection -- on his face.
Bieber showed off the new ink via Instagram on Saturday.
While this one has a lot of fans shaking their heads, it has even more people trying to figure out where the heck it is.
You have to look very closely at Bieber's selfie to spot the new tattoo, which is located just to the side of his left eye.
Beliebers have shared massively varying reactions about the new ink in the comments section, including "Omg you did not," "This is beautiful," and "uglyyyy" with two laugh-cry emojis.
The itty bitty ink was drawn by celebrity favorite Jonboy at his New York City shop, West 4 Tattoo, on Friday.
He's the same tattoo artist who gave Kylie Jenner her newest red tat just last week.
Jonboy shared his own photo of Bieber and the “Sorry” singer’s pal, photographer Joe Termini, that showed off the fresh ink.
It would take days to count every single one of Bieber's tattoos, but a few of his more recent adds include angel wings on the back of his neck , a new stomach tattoo , and an attempted cover-up of a portrait of his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez .
Earlier this year, Bieber told GQ that the angel wings were his favorite.
In the same interview, he also revealed that he was considering a face tattoo, possibly above his eyebrow, but wouldn't get one until "I'm really old, not super old, but maybe, like, 40s or 50s or something."
This means Bieber either ages in dog years or he got excited about the idea of a tattoo on his face a few decades early.
