Ginger Zee shined on Monday's Dancing With the Stars and the Good Morning America weather anchor and her pro partner, Val Chmerkovskiy, nabbed the first perfect score of the season.
Dancing a Viennese waltz to Whitney Houston's 1993 song "I Have Nothing," Zee and Chmerkovskiy delivered an emotionally-charged performance that brought judge Carrie Ann Inaba to tears with its beauty.
"It was powerful, it was elegant, it was perfection!"
Inaba gushed, almost crying again as she spoke with the duo after their dance.
"It was like a cool breeze on a warm summer's day," judge Len Goodman added.
"It was refreshing, it had just the right amount of everything."
Judge Bruno Tonioli kept the praise train rolling, telling Zee and Chmerkovskiy that it was their "best dance so far."
Upon hearing that they received three 10s, Chmerkovskiy lifted Zee for a spinning hug, and the 35-year-old new mom told co-host Erin Andrews that she was "overwhelmed."
"That is awesome!"
Zee yelled, before thanking the judges.
The score put Zee at the top of the leaderboard, and when the double elimination rolled around she and Chmerkovskiy predictably avoided being in jeopardy.
However, two teams got the axe on Monday.
Wayna Morris , Von Miller and Kim Fields found themselves in jeopardy.
Ultimately, Morris' slew of impressive scores carried him and partner Lindsay Arnold to safety, meaning Miller and Fields hit the bricks.
Check out the video below for a look at Morris' NSYNC performance from last weeks' DWTS that earned him a near-perfect 29.
