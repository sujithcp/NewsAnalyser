Kaley Cuoco poked fun at her love life on Monday's Late Show , joking with host Stephen Colbert that she's in a new relationship -- with a man dressed in a banana costume.
The Big Bang Theory star hit the stage hand-in-hand with Mr. Banana -- a character who had appeared in an unrelated sketch earlier in the episode -- and "revealed" that the bizarre character was her new boyfriend.
"I just thought I would take this time, since everyone is so concerned with who I'm dating, to say that is who I'm dating.
The banana man," Cuoco shared.
"We're in a very serious relationship."
This must have been news to the 30-year-old actress' real boyfriend, Karl Cook , who accompanied Cuoco to the Late Show taping.
The couple were spotted heading into the studio earlier in the day.

Monday also happened to be the day Cuoco finalized her divorce from her ex , 28-year-old tennis player Ryan Sweeting .
The two tied the knot in December 2013, but called it quits less than two years later when they decided to divorce in September 2015.
The couple had a prenuptial agreement, so each party will retain their respective assets.
However, Cuoco is required to pay Sweeting $165,000 in spousal support.
But the CBS star still has plenty to celebrate these days.
She and her new beau have been spending their time horseback riding and posting adorable Instagram pics.
Check out the video below for more on the c ute couple's burgeoning romance.
