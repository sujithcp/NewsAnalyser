The actress was seen with mother-in-law, Pamela Chopra in Switzerland at the unveiling of a bronze statue of Yash Chopra.
The otherwise private Rani Mukherji has made her first appearance since giving birth to Adira in December 2015.
She, along with mother-in- law Pamela Chopra, was present at the unveiling of a bronze statue of Yash Chopra in Interlaken, Switzerland on Wednesday.
The statue is a tribute to the legendary filmmaker by the Swiss government for capturing the exotic locales of their country for decades.
The statue shows Yash Chopra in his iconic pose of directing a film.
Yash Raj Films tweeted the picture, with much pride.
Rani is bathing in that post-natal glow and looks every bit proud and honoured on this occasion.
