It's a good thing Bella Hadid can look to her mom Yolanda Foster for modeling tips!
The 19-year-old beauty covers the June issue of Elle , where she bares a lot of skin, and shares her mom's tried-and-true advice for bringing expression out in your photos.

"My mom always taught me to think about something happy when I‚Äôm working, because it kind of shows through your face," Hadid reveals.
"I used to think about my horses, but now I think about other things."

And it seems to work!
Hadid enthusiastically shared her cover on Facebook, writing, "So excited to announce my first American @elleusa cover!!!!
Im so beyond happy.
üòçüíÉThank you @terrytsiolis for shooting this incredible story and @samiranasr for styling and always believing in me!
Such an amazing shoot with such talented people ‚ù§Ô∏è."
Meanwhile, one of the things (besides horses) that might be bringing Hadid smiles is her current beau, Abel Tesfaye, better known as The Weeknd.
The model opens up to the magazine about appearing in her boyfriend's super bloody "Into The Night" music video last year.
"I love seeing him happy and passionate about his art," she says of working on the project.
"Being able to see how he works, and put both of our workplaces together, turned out to be really beautiful."

In March, Hadid expressed gratitude for all the support she gets from The Weeknd.
"It's so awesome.
I love him, so it's really nice that we can be here together and that he's supporting me," she shared with ET at the Daily Front Row's Fashion Los Angeles Awards, where Hadid was honored as Model of the Year.
"It feels great."
