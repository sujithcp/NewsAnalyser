Nothing beats a LBD!
Jessica Simpson hit the streets with her hunky hubby, Eric Johnson, on Tuesday for a night out on the town.
The couple was spotted outside of the Hollywood hotspot The Nice Guy, where the fashion designer wore a fitted black dress with strappy heels.
The mother of two wore her blonde locks down as her beau helped her into their car.
The parents enjoyed their night without their kids, Maxwell, 4, and Ace, 2, who they’re already starting to see grow up fast.

"My kids have the biggest personalities ever," Simpson recently told The Huffington Post .
"I know every mom would probably say that about their children, but I guess I’m just one of those moms who likes to brag about how adorable their kids are."
She also added that her children might have a future in music.
"It’s cute, they both love music and they like to dance and circle around each other," she said.
"My daughter is trying to learn to break dance at the moment, she has one move --she puts her hands down and puts her leg up like she’s break dancing."
