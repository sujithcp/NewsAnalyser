Shay Mitchell is getting candid about her sexuality , revealing that she doesn’t feel a need to categorize her romantic orientation.
"When I started, people were like, 'What are you?'
I'm like, right now I'm dating a guy.
I don't know what it's going to be in three years," the Pretty Little Liars star revealed in an interview with Cosmopolitan for the magazine's June issue.

"You love who you love: Black, white, polka-dot.
That’s what my dad always said," Mitchell explained.
"I’m never going to label myself.
I could be 50 and dating a woman and then what?
I said I was straight and now I'm not?"
Mitchell's character on Pretty Little Liars , Emily Fields, also had a fluid experience defining her sexuality during the course of the show.
When the series began in 2010, Emily had a relationship with a male classmate before realizing and accepting her attraction to women .
Mitchell has played Emily for the entirety of the series' run, with the seventh season kicking off later this year.
However, when the popular drama does come to a close, Mitchell hopes to go on to even bigger things.
"I’d rather have a company," the 29-year-old actress revealed.
"I don’t want to be dependent on a call from my agent -- taking projects I’m not OK with because I need to.
To be honest, winning an Oscar is not one of my goals."
