Barely a week after its release, the director of the much-talked about Marathi movie Sairat has approached the Cyber Police Station in Mumbai seeking action against unknown persons who have leaked the movie online.
According to sources, the producer and director of Sairat , Nagraj Manjule, approached the police with his complaint earlier this week.
“A high quality version of the movie has been leaked on at least three different websites.
The quality indicates that it was done by someone with access to a studio print of the movie,” a source said.
The Cyber police have started the process of tracing the Internet Protocol address from which the movie was uploaded on the internet, and is also gathering information about all such people who might have had access to a high quality print of the movie.
Mr Manjule also met senior Mumbai Police officers on Tuesday and discussed the case with them, said sources.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) M Rajkumar and Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Atulchandra Kulkarni could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.
The Cyber police is also investigating a similar case filed with them in January this year, after a high quality print of Mahesh Manjrekar’s movie Natasamrat was leaked on the Internet soon after its release.
An FIR was filed against unknown persons, and investigations are underway.
Sairat, an epic love story cut short by hate.
