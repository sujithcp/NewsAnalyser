Demi Lovato looked stunning at the Met Gala on Monday night, but apparently, the singer didn’t have the best time at the elegant event!
Lovato posted an awkwardly candid pic of herself on the red carpet to Instagram on Tuesday, showing off the moment when she approached rapper Nicki Minaj and Moschino director Jeremy Scott to pose for pics.
“This picture pretty much summed up my first and probably last met 😂😂😂,” the singer wrote, adding some appropriate hashtags.
“#cool #sof***ingawkward #notforme #sweatpants #forensicfiles #whatsgood.”
In all fairness, Lovato snapped some solid Moschino squad shots with Minaj and Scott after the awkward moment.
And she later updated her Instagram caption to clarify that there was no offense taken at Minaj’s intense expression.

“P.s.
some of y'all need to learn how to take a joke,” Lovato added.
“I'm obviously laughing at the fact that 1.
I look incredibly awkward and 2.
That the shade being thrown in this picture actually gives me life 🙌🏼😂.”
The singer flew solo at Monday’s event without boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama on her arm.
