Lovato, 23, also posted a photo of her longtime boyfriend, Wilmer Valderrama, staring into Batman's eyes as they sat in the car, which she captioned "Daddy" with another heart emoji.

It makes a lot of sense that Lovato and Valderrama dote over their dog, as last year, they had a few devastating months when it came to their pets.
First, her dog, Buddy , died in July 2015 in a what Lovato described as "a tragic accident."
Then five months later, the couple lost their Doberman Pinscher, Spawn .
Valderamma was devastated after he lost his pup of eight years, penning a lengthy post on Instagram after his death.
"Yesterday, I said goodbye to my handsome boy Spawn, this year has been quite a roller coaster," the 36-year-old actor wrote on Dec. 27, 2015.
"Lots of emotions and lots thresholds crossed.
This boy was there for it all.."
Batman was a bright spot last year, especially since Lovato got him for her birthday in August.
The massive amounts of love aren't saved just for her animals, however.
Lovato recently gushed over Valderamma , who she admitted was "more passionate" than her previous boyfriends.
