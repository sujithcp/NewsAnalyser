Moretz's Watch What Happens Live!
appearance was definitely notable, as she finally confirmed her relationship with Victoria and David Beckham's 17-year-old son, Brooklyn Beckham.
"I think the more I don't make it mysterious, the more people don't care, so yes, we're in a relationship," she shared.
"He's a great dad, she's a great mother," she added about her beau's famous parents.
"They genuinely are very good parents [and] that's what matters most.

They made a pretty son."
Moretz is currently busy promoting Neighbors 2 -- out May 20th -- which brings back Seth Rogen and Zac Efron for the highly anticipated sequel.
