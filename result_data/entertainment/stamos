John Stamos is quite the jokester.
The 52-year-old Fuller House actor took to Instagram on Thursday to share a hilarious video taken during a recent vacation getaway.
In the brief clip, which he captioned "#AwkwardVacationMoments" and tagged @robloweofficial, Stamos was hilariously mistaken for Rob Lowe by a not-so-up-to-date fan.
"What, who did you think -- what's my name?"
he asked.
"Rob, what?"
Instead of correcting the confused woman, who was convinced he was "Rob Lowe," he let it slide, soaking in all the awkwardness.
"That's right, yeah, hi," he stated before flashing a cheesy smile for a selfie.
We have to give it to her, though.
The two both have sexy smiles, similar hairstyles and bright-colored eyes.
Oh, and did we mention they're the same age?
Looking so good must be such a hard feat for an "ex teen-idol," as Stamos so perfectly describes himself on Twitter .
We can only imagine that his new girlfriend , model and actress Caitlin McHugh, is loving this mishap, too.
ET caught up with Stamos' Fuller House co-star Jodie Sweetin backstage at Dancing With the Stars in March, where she couldn't stop gushing over Stamos' brunette beauty.
"I actually met her a couple days ago.
She is delightful," Sweetin revealed.
"She's really sweet and we are welcoming her into the family.
They're adorable, and we really like her."
