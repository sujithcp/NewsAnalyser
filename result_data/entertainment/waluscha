Model-turned-actress Waluscha De Sousa, who co-starred with Shah Rukh Khan in Fan to debut in Bollywood, said she was left impressed that despite scaling heights in stardom the superstar is so "humble".
She also shared that working with Bollywood's 'Baadshah' has been an enriching experience for her.
"It is a wonderful experience.
I mean he (SRK) is so hard-working and so passionate about what he does and through it all he is such a huge star but so humble," Waluscha told IANS over phone from Mumbai.
After ruling the ramp as a model and then putting her professional life on the back burner for her family, Waluscha decided to take the leap into Bollywood with Fan .
Directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Yash Raj Films, the movie, which released on April 15, featured Shah Rukh in double roles - one as a superstar and other his look-alike fan Gaurav.
Waluscha plays the role of Aaryan Khanna's wife on the silver screen.
The 31-year-old-actress added: "It is a great pleasure and for me it was a huge learning experience to be on the set with him (SRK)".
