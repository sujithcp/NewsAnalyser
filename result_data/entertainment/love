How in love can two people be?
?
Keith Urban absolutely gushes over wife Nicole Kidman in a new interview airing this weekend on CBS Sunday Morning , where he says that the couple's marriage nearly 10 years ago "wasnâ€™t life changing, it was life beginning."
"It was literally, like, 'Okay, life starts,'" the country music star adds.

Of course, this is far from the first time the couple has showed major PDAINIY (public displays of "All I neeeed is you!")
for each other.
Last week at the Met Gala, the darling duo shared the most passionate-looking kiss ever after Kidman cooed that Urban was "more beautiful" after Vogue 's Andre Leon Talley complimented her attire.
And just last month, Nicole actually made her husband blush on the ACM Awards red carpet while commenting on the love he puts into his work.
"I've been living with all the songs -- and even the songs that didn't make the album," she explained to ET.
"I've seen the work he puts into it and the love.
He's a musician, so every little tiny detail is all him, and I love that.
I love that he's passionate about his music."
