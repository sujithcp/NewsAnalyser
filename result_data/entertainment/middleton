Kate Middleton can't stop smiling!
Rocking a recycled twill jacquard swing coat from the 2014 Michael Kors collection, the Duchess of Cambridge officially opened the Magic Garden playground at Hampton Court Palace in London on Wednesday.
During her visit, she chatted and laughed with a lucky group of school children who got to play on it before anyone else.

To kick off the grand opening, Middleton, 34, had the honors of unveiling the interactive garden's shiny plague and celebrating with a colorful cake.
While touring the new children's play area, which is inspired by the myths and legends of the Tudor Palace, Middleton peered into the dragon's nest attraction "to say hello to a couple of children" who were playing inside.
According to one of the girls she was chatting with, Middleton and Prince William's two children, Prince George , 2, and Princess Charlotte , 1, have another royal pet -- a hamster named Marvin!
(They also have a dog named Lupo.)
"[Princess Kate] said she had a hamster and Charlotte really likes it because the whiskers always tickle her face," 9-year-old Darcey reported.
The royal also revealed that she had two of her own guinea pigs, Salt and Pepper, when she was growing up in Chapel Row, England.
Later in the day, the Duchess visited the Anna Freud Centre, which marked her first engagement as patron of the children's mental health charity.
She wore yet another one of her favorite recycled pieces , a gray Peridot dress by Serbian designer Roksanda Ilincic, to the event.

According to a tweet from Kensington Palace, "The Duchess spoke to parents from @AFCevents family school, providing specialist education for the whole family."
Opening the new playground wasn't the only celebration for Middleton this week, however.
