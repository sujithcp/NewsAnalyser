Come on, Jess, take our breath away!
That’s right, it looks like Jessica Simpson is heading back to the recording studio for the first time since her Christmas album, Happy Christmas , was released in November 2010.
Simpson posted several black and white photos of herself in the recording studio, giving fans of her music so unexpected excitement after years away.
“Studio Vibin’,” she captioned one photo.
She also posted a pic with the legendary Linda Perry in the studio.
In September 2015, Simpson opened up about her music career on the Today show , revealing that her husband and two kids haven’t known her as a recording artist.
“I recorded a Christmas album with him, but he has never really seen me onstage, and do my thing that actually got me here," she said of husband Eric Johnson.
"That's how I started, and that's one of my biggest passions in the world.
I love to use my voice."
