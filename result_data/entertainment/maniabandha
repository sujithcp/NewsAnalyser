The echoes of the loom can be heard from every house in the remote Maniabandha village in Cuttack district.
The pata khandua saris are woven here with hand-spun cotton threads dyed in the traditional vegetable colours.
The typical motifs are done in tie-and-dye technique.
The khandua (lower cloth) is used to dress the deity at Puri’s Jagannath Temple.
This special cloth has verses and illustrations from Gita Govinda woven into it.
The red and orange khandua saris, worn by the villagers, havemotifs of elephants, peacocks, large flowers and chakras and look different from the other ikkats of Odisha.
In the 7th century, a Buddhist community that migrated to Maniabandha wove fine fabric with these motifs.Over time the community left the region but the locals weavers continued the tradition of weaving the distinctive pata khandua saris.
Says Manoranjan Thor, paramparik weaver from Maniabandha, whose creations are being showcased at Sanginee, “A special feature is the temple border.
The colours have been changed from the usual red and orange to include green, blue and purple.
The design is borrowed from Sambalpuri ikkats.” Also available are dupattas and table linen in Maniabandha.
Maniabandha ikkat range is on view till May 21 at Sanginee, C.P.
Ramaswamy Road.
