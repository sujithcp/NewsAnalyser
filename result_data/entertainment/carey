Mariah Carey made for one very sexy bat mitzvah guest!
The 46-year-old pop diva turned up to the massive, luxurious coming-of-age affair for her manager's daughter wearing a long-sleeved black mesh dress that left almost nothing to the imagination.
Though there was a built-in bodysuit that covered her private areas, the revealing pattern showed off her cleavage and stomach.

Carey seemed to have a great time at the private fête, which took place at 1OAK in Hollywood, California, on Friday.
Not only could she be seen dancing while holding a drink in hand, the "We Belong Together" singer also DJ'd at the party for Mishka Bulochnikov, dubbed "Mishka B's Epic Bat Mitzvah."
Before stealing the show Friday night, Carey celebrated Mother's Day a little early.
She had a friendly dinner with her ex-husband, Nick Cannon, and their twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on Thursday.
Carey opened up to ET last month about planning a "traditional" wedding with Packer, an Australian billionaire businessman.
