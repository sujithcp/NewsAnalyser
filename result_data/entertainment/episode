The last time a Game of Thrones episode title took an "Oath," it resulted in one of the most jaw-dropping moments A Song of Ice and Fire book readers ever encountered.
It was back in season four's "Oathkeeper," deriving its name from the Valyrian sword Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) bestowed upon Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie).
But more importantly, it solidified the show's oath to shock all of its viewers, readers included, by taking the audience into White Walker headquarters for the very first time, and introducing them to the menacing Night's King.
This week, season six pledges its own "Oath," in the upcoming third episode of the year: "Oathbreaker."
The preview for the episode promises to again toy with readers' expectations, not by deviating from the books, but by bringing one of its most iconic moments to life.
Read on for a closer look at what the latest trailer tells us about the next hour of Thrones .
He's back!
So, now what?
Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is back on his feet in the third episode of season three, and based on what Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) tells him, the folks at Castle Black are impressed: "They think you're some kind of god."
Is it hyperbole, or does Jon have unknown power in his renewed state?
The very act of resurrection in itself is enough to grab attention, of course.
Either way, Jon Snow's next steps are sure to be an event.
"A girl is not a beggar anymore."
Jaqen H'Ghar (Tom Wlaschiha) delivered music to the ears of Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) fans everywhere in episode two, pulling her off the streets and resuming her Faceless training.
Now, she's back in the House of Black and White, wielding her staff and tasked with learning an important new lesson: "If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear."
Back in season five, Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) delivered a gift to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in the form of a man: Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage).
It was a welcome surprise to be sure, both for Dany and for viewers.
Expect a similar kind of gift in "Oathbreaker," as Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) receives a present of his own.
Smart money says it's a human captive — the return of his Reek (Alfie Allen), perhaps?
Although popular theories suggest the new Lord of Winterfell might encounter another of the castle's old inhabitants …
Daenerys — also known as Nobody, Millionth of Her Name and Queen of Nothing, according to Khal Moro (Joseph Naufahu) — finally reaches Vaes Dothrak in this week's episode, according to the preview.
Is she destined to live out her days with the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of fallen Khals?
Not likely, but knowing Dany, expect her to make some new friends among her new roommates … after amassing a few new enemies, of course.
"If someone is planning on making our losses their gains, then I want to hear it."
So saith Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), finally re-energized after episode two's words of encouragement from her son and king Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman).
Now, she's back on the path of vengeance, but who's the target?
Is it the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce), Dorne, both?
Whomever she's after, she has a head-smashing secret weapon in her corner: Robert Strong (Hafthor Bjornsson), the Goldar to Cersei's Rita Repulsa .
"Now it begins."
"Now it ends."
Book readers know these words by heart.
It's the start of one of the most historic battles in Westeros history: Eddard Stark and his Northern allies against Arthur Dayne and the Targaryen Kingsguard, at the tail end of Robert's Rebellion, years before Thrones begins.
The sequence finally looks set to take place in "Oathbreaker," and with it, one of the most important questions in all of Thrones lore might finally receive its definitive answer … and if rumors pan out, then yes, it involves Jon Snow.

The Three-Eyed Witness
As if the Tower of Joy needed further intrigue, the preview sees two unexpected observers at the scene: Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and the Three-Eyed Raven (Max von Sydow).
The information contained at the Tower boasts Game- changing potential, but fans always wondered how it would be revealed to the relevant characters.
With Bran able to view the past, however, the answer becomes much clearer.
Expect the Three-Eyed Raven's student to walk away from this episode with some major answers under his belt.
