The replica of Sri Parthasarathy of Thiruvallikeni on the first day and that of Sri Varadaraja Perumal of Kancheepuram on the second against a colourful stage backdrop were the much-appreciated highlights of ‘Sri Ramanujar Dharisanam,’ on at Narada Gana Sabha (May 10-13).
Bringing Ramanujar's statue in procession into the auditorium, with the sacred umbrella and live musicians completing the paraphernalia, set the tone for the show that took the viewers to another plane.
And the message that came across was Ramanuja’s relevance continues even today.
A Divyanajali participant summed it up in a conversation backstage.
“I learnt that equality is not a modern concept.
It was propagated by Ramanuja, who called other caste people to dine in his house,” said young K. Upanisha.
“I also learnt the power of Narayana nama,” she added.
Compere Revathy Sankaran, clad in a beautiful red nine-yards sari said she also wrote the lines for the dances.
Roping in youngsters to perform was a good idea.
In a post-event conversation, dancer Vandhana said, “I’m taking home his dedication to his gurus, and his belief in himself.”
“I learnt the importance of humanity,” said Deepika, another young participant.

Dhamal Ramakrishnan's discourse on the first day was on Ramanuja's early years, beginning from his birth.
“Vazhikattiya Varadan,” a nicely encapsulated piece by Divyasena's group Divyanjali presented a visual depiction.
Udayalur Kalyanaraman's Namsankeerthanam provided the fitting finale.
In his discourse, “Ramanujarin Bhakti Vellam,” Sri Velukkudi Krishnan explained how Kancheepuram, where Ramanujar grew up, has special connotations.
It was here that Ramanuja moved after his marriage, to study under guru Yadava Prakasa.
“Every atma is different, but all atmas are equal,” Velukkudi Krishnan said explaining the Acharya’s philosophy.
Each has to follow his path to Moksha, said Ramanuja, who proceeded to reach Srirangam.
The Divyanjali group portrayed the episode of Ramanuja writing Sri Bhashyam.
The evening concluded with the moving rendition of abhangs by young Spoorthi and Pragathi.
The final part of Sri Ramanuja’s journey will be presented today at the event put together by Kausthuba Media works, and Bhakti Sagaram.
