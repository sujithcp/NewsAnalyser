Emma Watson has been named in the Panama Papers leak, the release of millions of confidential documents concerning offshore accounts that has incited accusations of tax evasion and money laundering.
But the Harry Potter actress' rep denies the account was used for any unethical dealings.
"Emma (like many high profile individuals) set up an offshore company for the sole purpose of protecting her anonymity and safety," Watson's rep tells Independent in a statement.
"UK companies are required to publicly publish details of their shareholders and therefore do not give her the necessary anonymity required to protect her personal safety, which has been jeopardized in the past owing to such information being publicly available," Watson's rep states.
"Offshore companies do not publish these shareholder details," the statement continues.
"Emma receives absolutely no tax or monetary advantages from this offshore company whatsoever -- only privacy."
The Panama Papers contained information from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonesca, the world's fourth biggest offshore account law firm, USA Today reports.
It is the "biggest leak in the history of data journalism," according to Edward Snowden .
Watson's name is listed as the owner of a British Virgin islands company called Falling Leaves Ltd.
Other famous names found in the leak include Simon Cowell, Jackie Chan, Dancing With the Stars alum Heather Mills and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
