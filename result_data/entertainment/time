The cutie was completely in his element during the Kolkata Knight Riders' match held at the Eden Gardens in the ninth season of the ongoing Indian Premier League.
Before the match began, SRK had tweeted about his visit to the stadium with his son.
All eyes were glued on to the stands to catch a glimpse of the adorable father-son duo.
While they were seen playing inside the glass panels during the match, post the game, the two descended down on the grounds and played with each other.
While the last time AbRam had played with bottles of water, this time, it was the water itself that interested him.
The duo sprinkled water on each other and seemed to have quite a good time doing so.
AbRam's antics also caught the attention of the cameraman and the everyone got a glimpse of the cutie's playtime shenanigans.
Now we know why Shah Rukh Khan loves spending time with the munchkin!
