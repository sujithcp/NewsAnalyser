Kathie Lee Gifford is mourning the loss of her 10-year-old puppy, Louis.
The Today host took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to pay tribute to her adorable Bichon Frise , posting a throwback pic of the precious white pooch wearing a gold crown and an ascot.
"Hail!
King Louis!
You were dearly loved.
R.I.P.
2006-2016," Gifford wrote alongside the heartfelt photo.
Gifford, 62, later thanked her followers and fans for their outpouring of kindness following the death of her beloved pet , tweeting, "Many thanks for all your love and support regarding the loss of our precious Louis.
You comfort us and we are grateful."
Last Christmas, Gifford took to Twitter to share her thoughts about the loss of her husband, Frank Gifford , who passed away in August 2015 at the age of 84 .
It was the talk show host's first holiday season without her husband of nearly 30 years and she spent the week leading up to Christmas posting poignant Bible verses.
