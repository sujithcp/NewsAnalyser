Unidentified man climbed tower of KTLA in Los Angeles on May 11, 2106
HOLLYWOOD -- Authorities shut a portion of a busy street here for hours after a man climbed the transmission tower of KTLA, reports CBS Los Angeles .
The Sunset Boulevard closure Wednesday afternoon caused a traffic nightmare, KCBS-TV says.
There was no initial word on what prompted him to climb the tower, but police said a good Samaritan persuaded him to climb down by offering him a hug.
The woman told CBS Los Angeles she knew the man from a local church, where she recently handed out food to him.
By 8 p.m., he had descended from the tower.
Streets were reopened soon after.
Police said the man was expected to undergo a mental health evaluation.
