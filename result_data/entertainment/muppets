Once ABC's highest hope, the series crashed and burned faster than Fozzie can tell a corny joke.
Kermit the Frog may one day find that rainbow connection, but it won't be at ABC.
The reboot of The Muppets has been canceled after one beleaguered season.
Picked up to series after a short pilot presentation and rushed to a fall premiere, The Muppets reboot started the season as the biggest can't-miss of the freshman class after earning a rare standing ovation at San Diego Comic-Con.
What happened since was the stuff of TV legend.
Co-created by Bill Prady — who started his career under Jim Henson on The Muppets — and comedy veteran Bob Kushell, ABC's Kermit and Piggy break-up marketing campaign went viral as the network focused much of its fall budget on promoting the return of a TV favorite with a new and edgy show-within-a-show concept.
The series premiere surprised ratings watchers when it topped Fox's heavily promoted Ryan Murphy anthology Scream Queens in head-to-head competition despite a wave of lackluster reviews .
Subsequent episodes stumbled creatively as critics continued to take issue with the show's depressing stories .
Picked up for only three additional episodes, co-creator Kushell was forced out and Galavant 's Kristin Newman was tapped as showrunner in a bid to salvage the series and retool The Muppets reboot .
Vowing to bring back classic sketches and old favorites, the show returned after the holiday break to a string of series lows.
The Muppets finished its freshman season with a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49 and 5.3 million total viewers.
The Muppets joins other series to get the ax at ABC on Thursday including Castle, Nashville and Agent Carter .
