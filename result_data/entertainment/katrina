Katrina Kaif and Ranbir Kapoor’s Jagga Jasoos has been in the making for long now.
The film directed by Anurag Basu went through severe roadblocks and delays.
The fact that Ranbir – Katrina parted ways did not help the movie much.
Rumours were that the couple wasn’t willing to come back on sets and reports also suggested that Katrina was delaying the shoot and was instead prioritising Baar Baar Dekho opposite Sidharth Malhotra.
However, the actress rubbished all these stories and vowed that she was being a thorough professional.
But looks like the makers now have some fresh trouble thanks to Katrina.
A source told BollywoodLife, “Katrina has changed so much since Jagga Jasoos shoot started last year.
She has lost oodles of weight and because of this there’s major continuity issue.” The source further added that Anurag confronted Katrina too about the same, but she felt that her new lean mean look cannot be blamed.
The makers aren’t too thrilled to appreciate Kat’s this makeover and are in fact fretting over it.
And so now we hear that the re-shoots are happening and the makers are hoping to fix this major jump on CGI.
Well, both Katrina and Ranbir have kept their differences aside and are working on Jagga Jasoos .
Katrina and Ranbir are hoping that their movie does not get affected.
After all one cannot forget that RK Jr’s last few movies have failed to perform at the box office or win the critics and Katrina too had Fitoor , which didn’t exactly do wonders for her career.
With this latest glitch, we hope that Basu and his team manage to finally can the shots they desired to.
