From rehearsing for hours for dance sequences, to sweating it out at the gym to get that perfect body for a role — Katrina Kaif always puts her best foot forward to prepare for her films.
Her physique became the talk of the town when she performed at the opening ceremony of the Indian Premier League recently.
Apart from making sure she looks good on the big screen, Katrina also understands the importance of staying fit.
Apparently, the actor, who is currently shooting for a movie in Morocco, has made it a point to exercise daily after pack-up.
A source says, “Katrina wants to stay in shape.
She has been utilising her spare time after the shoot finishes to work out with her trainer, Reza Katani, who has travelled with her to Morocco.
He stays with Katrina on the sets all the time.
She trained with him for Dhoom:3 (2013) as well.”
Despite her hectic schedule, the actor doesn’t miss out on a single session.
“Katrina is very disciplined.
She trains with Reza for two to three hours daily.
She mostly does Pilates,” says the source, adding, “There’s speculation that Katrina is shaping up for her upcoming film.
But her look has been kept under wraps, so no one knows.”
We tried contacting Katrina, but she remained unavailable for a comment.
