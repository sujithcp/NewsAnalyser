On a hot, sultry late evening at Bhoot Bangla in Madhapur, cinematographer Natraj Subramaniam is all set for instructions from director Trivikram Srinivas.
A couple of days more and it is a wrap of A..Aa, his debut vehicle in Telugu.
He is neither a graduate from a film institute nor did he own a camera; yet from being a still photographer at weddings to being a cinematographer of high budget movies in Bollywood, Natraj has come a long way.
Tall, with intense eyes, you almost mistake him to be an actor.
He is actually one; in the past few years he had taken up acting in Tamil cinema seriously and is open to picking up roles if he finds the script exciting.
Otherwise he is happy working for accomplished filmmakers in Mumbai; Parineeta, Jab We Met, Lafange Parindey, Love Aaj Kal, Desi Boyz, Ekalavya, Black Friday and Ranjhaana are a part of his repertoire and his recent film in Tamil was Puli .
A..Aa
So how did he break into this world of movies?
“Even in school I didn't think of math, physics and chemistry and my mind was on cinematography.
I studied in corporation schools and there were none to guide us; parents just wanted us to study well and get good grades.
I planned to do diploma in Mechanical Engineering and joined a course but then got pulled towards cinematography.
However, I could never afford a camera.
Buying one was a very expensive affair those days, at least for me.
I was borrowing a camera from friends and would rent it out.
If I get 100 bucks, 50 would go to the camera and printing process and I would get only ten.
That's how life moved," narrates the technician who is fondly known as Natty to industry folks.
He elaborates on how he grew to be a cinematographer.
“Making a print is a big process.
A friend had a lab where I would watch him and understand the process, and not depend on post-production.
That's where I got an edge.
I began observing others’ films and experimented on my own.
I would convey the script through lighting.
Whenever I read a script, I would implement the scenes ...i.e I make a visual and read it on screen.
He adds, “All my films are different.
My video films with Pradeep Sarkar and Shoojit Sircar got me mileage.
People loved the lighting style and my raw approach in Paanch and I was offered work by many filmmakers."
Natraj rates Trivikram Srinivas as a genius; the director is not only a post graduate in nuclear science, but can talk on anything.
He remarks, “As one says in Tamil, he is a Varaprasadam ...a blessing, a gift.
If you are learning from him and getting paid too, what more do you want?
Also, the blending of characters in A ..Aa is interesting; that’s the reason I agreed to work in it.”
What about acting?
Natraj and his friends pooled in money to help their friend become a director as he couldn’t find a producer for his script.
When actor Prashant Narain who had even been taught Tamil in the local Chennai slang for the film opted out, Natty was asked to replace him, that's how an actor was born.
