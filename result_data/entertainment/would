Shark Tank star and real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran received major backlash following her now-deleted tweet which stated, "I find running a #business in a man's world to be a huge advantage.
I wear bright colors, yank up my skirt + get attention."
But Corcoran, 67, is not apologizing for her controversial comment.
On Thursday, the mother of two took part in several press junkets including Access Hollywood to defend, even encourage, her statements.
"When I was building my business, I would walk into a room of 600 men in dark suits and I dress like a guy in a nice pant suit, no one would say hi to me no one would entertain me," Corcoran told Billy Bush and Kit Hoover.
"The minute I started wearing bright suits and I would have a nice length skirt on, I would just roll up the middle and walk into that room, everyone paid attention to me," she continued also adding, "And you know what you're crazy if you don't use that in building a business, men do it."
To state her point further, Corcoran used Bush as an example of the sexist wardrobe standards.
"Men buy the Tom Ford suit, look at you, you're flexing the muscles right here.
That suit you didnâ€™t buy that on purpose one size too small," she said to the soon-to-be Today show correspondent .
Aside from what women should wear in the workplace, Corcoran also explained her beliefs of a nonexistent work-life balance, especially for employed mothers.
"It's like chasing a phantom," she described.
"If you're a woman, you're gonna do the line share of the household organizational work, the child rearing, the planning the vacations and you're gonna hold a job too.
If men had to do that stuff, let me tell you the whole economy wouldn't work out, it would collapse."
Concluding, "So there's no such thing as balance, I gave that up probably 20 years ago and I don't even hope for it."
