Quantico will be shooting Season 2 in New York City and hence, Priyanka Chopra is looking at apartments.
No, she's not signed another movie (yet).
Priyanka Chopra is looking for an apartment in Manhattan because Quantico is shifting production to New York.
This shift clearly indicates the popularity of the show and will generate up to 300 full-time jobs in the city, as reported by deadline.com.
ABC Studios' show's shoot will begin in July and post-production will continue till May 2017.
Season 2 of Quantico will have 22 episodes.
The show will also be able to take advantage of the tax credit of up to 30% which the state offers TV and film production.
The show was earlier being shot in Montreal, Canada, where PeeCee's mansion gave us all #LifeGoals and now she will rent an apartment in a posh area in NYC.
Priyanka is currently shooting for Baywatch with co-stars, Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, in which she will play the villain.
The film will be released in the US on May 19, 2017.
If reports from pinkvilla.com are to be believed, she was in New York with her mom two weeks back to check out a couple of places.
