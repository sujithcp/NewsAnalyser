Priyanka Chopra is an international star.
With a parallel career in Bollywood and Hollywood, the sultry siren has managed to garner a humongous fan following.
Priyanka is currently busy shooting for her Hollywood movie, 'Baywatch' opposite Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.
Priyanka will be playing a sexy villain, Victoria Leeds, in the flick.
We recently came across a still from the movie and are in total awe of the beauty queen.
Priyanka looks smokin' hot in a floral bodycon dress with a plunging neckline.
The director of the movie, Seth Gordon is seen standing behind her.
Judging by the pic, we are sure PC's fashion game is on point in the movie and we can hardly wait for the Padma Shri recipient to work her magic on the big screen.

There is no doubt that Priyanka Chopra, with her enviable achievements, both in national and international arenas, is making us feel super proud of her.
After an international single, a mainstream American TV show, 'Quantico' and a
negative role
in 'Baywatch', Priyanka is undoubtedly one of the most sought-after actresses around.
PeeCee, who will soon head to the US to shoot for the remaining portions of 'Baywatch', shared a picture on her Instagram account where she is seen posing with her co-star, Dwayne Johnson (popularly known as The Rock) from the sets of the movie and she looks hotness personified to say the least.
That's not all.
The diva even wished Dwayne a very happy birthday as she wrote, “Haaaaappy birthday DJ..@therock have a wonderful year and lots of happiness to u.. God bless you and your kind heart.
See you back on set..#Baywatch.” For those not in the know,
Priyanka Chopra
will be seen in a negative role opposite Johnson in 'Baywatch' and that, for sure, is one film we are waiting for with bated breath!

The actress who had been shooting for the second season of her American telly series, ‘Quantico,’ is back on the sets of her Hollywood debut ‘Baywatch.’ The actress had earlier posted a picture of her with wind-blown air announcing the return of Victoria reed (her character in the film) and we now came across this picture of the girl sporting the trademark red of the ‘Baywatch’ gang, though it’s not a bikini, but a dress.
Accompanying her is the entire cast of the film including Dwayne Johnson and Zac Effron.
While the actress looks all happy to be back with her 'Baywatch' team, she also had a fun time celebrating Holi with her 'Quantico' team.

Priyanka Chopra
might be away from home, but her 'Quantico' team is making sure she doesn’t miss home too much.
We already know that PC shares an extremely warm bond with the entire 'Quantico' cast and so it came as no surprise to us when they all joined in for some fun with colours to celebrate Holi with the gorgeous diva.
Pee Cee took to Instagram to share the above picture of her colourful team (literally).
The actress’ post alongside read, “Holi Fever on the sets of Quantico!
A big thank you to my
Quantico
family for giving me a home away from home!
Quick guess... which one is me???
Happy Holi everyone!” We love how the girl hasn’t forgotten to wish her fans despite being away and tied down with an extremely hectic schedule.

/priyanka-chopras-interesting-instagram-pics/Sistah-Thats-what-Dwayne-Johnson-just-called-Priyanka-Chopra/eventshow/51254458.cmsIt is one thing to be working with a Hollywood superstar and it is an altogether different thing to have him go gaga over you.
And Priyanka Chopra is currently enjoying the latter as Dwayne Johnson, her co-star from her Hollywood debut, ‘Baywatch,’ seems to be absolutely smitten by her.
First we had a really cool announcement from him about Pee Cee having joined the ‘Baywatch’ team and now we have this… So PC, who plays a villain, just wrapped up her first schedule for the film and Dwanye took to Instagram to praise the actress.
He posted the above picture of them together saying, “Every great story starts with a great villain... My sistah @priyankachopra is one of the biggest and most beloved stars in the world.
When I asked her how she felt about playing opposite me as our main #BAYWATCH villain she simply said with a sly and seductively evil smile, "Oh you're going down..." Cool is the rule, but sometimes bad is bad.
Thank you PC for the strong work week and see you on the rebound in GA. #GoodLordIGotMyHandsFull #ChopraDontPlay #BAYWATCH SUMMER 2017.” Clearly we aren’t the only ones head-over-heels in love with this ‘Desi girl’!

/priyanka-chopras-interesting-instagram-pics/Is-Priyanka-Chopras-Baywatch-shoot-over/eventshow/51237545.cmsTo say that Priyanka Chopra has made us all very proud is nothing short of an understatement.
The actress first broke the stereotypical Indian image on American Television with her stint as an FBI agent in ‘Quantico’ and became a rage with the American audiences, she then went on to present at the Oscars 2016, becoming the first Bollywood celeb to do so.
As if we weren’t already head-over-heels in love with Queen Pri, the actress will now make her Hollywood debut with Dwayne Johnson’s ‘Baywatch.’ We earlier informed you that Pee Cee will be seen essaying the role of a baddie, Victoria Leeds, in the film.
And it looks like the girl is done shooting her part, or so suggests her recent Insta post.
The actress shared the above pic of hers looking out the window of her car saying, ““Something magical about Miami!
Last night shoot!
being bad is so good!
#VictoriaLeeds u will be missed!
#Baywatch … until next time!
!” Well that seems like a good bye, doesn’t it?

It’s official.
Priyanka Chopra is a vital contributing factor to global warming because the girl has set temperatures soaring with her new stills as Victoria Leed, her character in her upcoming Hollywood debut film, ‘Baywatch.’ And boy does she look hot!

We had earlier informed you that Priyanka will essay the role of a baddie in the Dwayne Johnson and Zac Effron-starrer, which is an adaptation of the eponymous TV series.
And we have to admit, we are a little surprised as the girl looks more angelic than evil.

However, Priyanka's not homesick at all.
She was spotted having dinner at a local restaurant with her workmates after a script reading session of the second episode.
Apparently, She has over four times the number of followers on Twitter as compared to the entire TV network, ABC, which is producing her show.
This has made Pee Cee quite popular with the group.
