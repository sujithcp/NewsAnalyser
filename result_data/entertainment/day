May the fourth be with you!
As one of the breakout stars of The Force Awakens , Daisy Ridley was understandably excited to celebrate "Star Wars Day," sharing several on-set pictures via Instagram to mark the occasion and writing on all of them, "HAPPY STAR WARS DAY Y'ALL!"
"This is team Dazzle; Lisa, Amanda and Callie (missing Sonny!)
AKA the incredible women that kept me going the whole way through the shoot," the 24-year-old actress wrote.
"Plus JJ in the back being a general BAWS!"
Ridley's co-star, John Boyega, also commemorated the day with a hilarious dancing stormtrooper video, explaining, "There is a reason I left these guys #starwarsday."
Since the film's release, Ridley and Boyega have become our favorite on-screen team, which is evidenced no more clearly than on the Force Awakens special features, where the two collaborate on a song together.
