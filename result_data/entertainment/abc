ABC's 'Castle' is coming to an end.
Castle is coming to an end after eight seasons.
The ABC drama has been canceled, according to Hollywood Reporter , following ongoing drama over the announced departure of the show's female lead, Stana Katic at the end of this season.
Anticipating the possible axe, the publication reports that ABC filmed an alternate happy ending for the show's May 16 series finale.
Of Katic's departure, ABC told ET in a statement last month: “We are grateful for Stana Katic’s talent and dedication to the series and we hope to continue our relationship."
Katic responded with her own statement, saying, "Rather than distract from what was an amazing experience I would just like to say that I'm very grateful to ABC for giving me the opportunity to be a part of a much beloved show.
Thank you to the fans.”
"Castle has been one of the greatest joys of my creative life, and I hope the show continues on for years to come," Katic's co-star Nathan Fillon wrote in April.
"Stana has been my partner all this time and I thank her for creating the character of Beckett who will live on for all of us as one of the greatest police officers on television."
