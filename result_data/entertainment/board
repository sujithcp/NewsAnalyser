In what could mark a historic truce between enfant terrible Anurag Kashyap and the censor Board, the director’s new film Raman Raghav 2.0 is all set to be cleared with few cuts.
This, in spite of the fact that this is probably the most bloody saga Kashyap has ever made.
The story of Raman Raghav, a serial killer in the 1960s in Mumbai, who bludgeoned more than 40 people to death, is not for the squeamish.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui delivers a chilling performance in the title role.
Surprisingly, the Board, known for indulging in headlong confrontations with Kashyap since 2003’s Paanch has taken a liberal view of the savage film.
Says a source from the Board, “Yes, Raman Raghav 2.0 is a violent film.
What else can we expect a film on a serial killer to be?
This is a cautionary crime story that must be seen by all adults.”
RR 2.0 has been recommended by the Board for an ‘Adults Only’ certificate with six cuts.
“Some of these are verbal dialogue cuts and there is one reference to incestuous sex that has been asked to be removed.
None of these cuts make a difference to the flow of the narrative,” says a source.
