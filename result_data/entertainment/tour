Janet Jackson is reportedly pregnant with her first child - two weeks before her 50th birthday.
The claim on American TV show Entertainment Tonight appears to confirm rumours that began when Jackson postponed her forthcoming tour last month.
In a video statement published on her website on 6 April, the singer said: "My husband and I are planning our family, so I'm going to have to delay the tour.
"Please, if you can try and understand that it's important that I do this now.
"I have to rest up - doctor's orders - but I have not forgotten about you.
I will continue the tour as soon as I possibly can."
Jackson has yet to confirm the pregnancy as she promotes her new song, the aptly named Dammn Baby.
The 49-year-old secretly wed Wissam Al Mana in 2012 - her third marriage.
She has made no secret of her desire to have a child and admitted in 2008 that she might have to adopt.
