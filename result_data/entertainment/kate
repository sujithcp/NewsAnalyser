Even when you're the Duchess of Cambridge, it has to be weird to see yourself in a museum.
Kate Middleton visited the National Portrait Gallery in London on Wednesday, where her recent British Vogue photos were unveiled as part of the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibit.

The Kensington Palace shared details of Kate's visit on Twitter, writing, "The Duchess views the #Vogue100 exhibition @NPGLondon, celebrating 100 years of @BritishVogue."
The century commemoration shoot was Kate's first ever in a magazine, and was photographed by Josh Olins in Norfolk, England.
The Duchess wore a light pink Alexander McQueen two-piece dress while admiring the work in the gallery.
