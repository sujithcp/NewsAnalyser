Rob Kardashian can't wait to be a father with pregnant fianc√©e Blac Chyna !
"I mean it's my first time, so everything is exciting, literally," the father-to-be said in a rare on-camera interview with E!
News at Tuesday's ChyMoji launch party in Los Angeles.
"I'm happy and I just like to keep it, you know, keep it private... as private as can be," Kardashian, 29, added.
"Rob was very close to his dad and lost him at a young age.
He's never felt like he had a real father figure," a source previously told PEOPLE .
"He's always wanted to give that to his own kids.
He's really a loving guy and will give a lot to his children
A Kardashian insider shared with PEOPLE that Kardashian West is the most supportive family member as of late.
"Kim is probably the one who is least shocked or upset about this.
She's telling people that she's excited to be an aunt again," the source explained.
"She has the attitude that this is family, you don't always have to agree with family, but you have to be there for them and be loyal to them."
