Presented By &
Justin Timberlake 's new single is here, and you can bet your booty that it will be all you hear throughout the summer.
The singer dropped his newest track "Can't Stop the Feeling" off the upcoming Trolls movie soundtrack tonight ( now available on Apple Music ) after teasing fans with snippets throughout the week, and it's definitely the feel-good anthem that you'll be blasting with your friends for the next few months.
With it's upbeat melody and his amazing vocals (especially when he hits that falsetto in the chorus!
), there's no stopping your body from dance, dance, dancing to the beat.
Seriously, we already envision all kinds of viral videos coming out of thisâ€”groups of people dancing to this song on the street, friends bike riding on the beach while singing along, wedding parties choreographing a routine for the reception, car rides with the top down and radio blasting.
Scott Vener described it, tweeting , "its on some dance MJ meets BILL WITHERS disco and u prob think I'm kidding but I'm not."
(Spoiler alert: He's not kidding.
That's actually a pretty accurate description.)
JT sent fans on a frenzy yesterday when he dropped a surprise move very few followers saw coming.
The former 'N Sync member announced a new song would be released in just two short days.
"#CantStopTheFeeling," he tweeted when asked what the new track would be called.
"2 more days."
While most of what he has coming up on his new album is hush-hush, Timberlake has dropped hints on who we might hear on the project.
From Pharrell to Little Big Town , J.T.
has been posting quite a few photos from the studio , revealing that he's been working with some big names on all different aspects of the music making process.
We can't wait!
Now, excuse us while we go express ourselves through the art of dance to JT's new single.
