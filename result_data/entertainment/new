As the new trailer for the Netflix series shows, Litchfield prison’s delicate
ecosystem is at near collapse thanks to an influx of new inmates, a fight over
leadership inside and out of the penitentiary's walls, and the original inmates
turning on each other.
Here are the moments that have us screaming, “What the f**k?
!” as we wait for the return of OITNB .
1.
“Good morning, Caputo’s office.
This is Ms. Jefferson speaking.”
Not only is Taystee ( Danielle Brooks ) the newest mother, she also appears to be a secretary for Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow).
Though, she’s not putting out any Peggy Olson vibes.
“My bad,” she yells out to Caputo as she fumbles with the phone.
2.
“It’s sardine time, b**ches.
We’re a for-profit prison now.”
Aleida Diaz (Elizabeth Rodriguez) says, reminding audiences of busloads inmates seen at the end of season three.
And from the looks of it, there are just too many women for Litchfield to handle.
3.
“People always trying to desexualize women my age and I just won’t allow it.”
Among Litchfield’s new inmates is Judy King (Blair Brown), a TV personality inspired by Martha Stewart (or is that Paula Deen?).
And from the looks of it, she’s found a friend in Poussey Washington ( Samira Wiley ) -- not that we’re upset about that!
4.
“I’m going to bury you!”
Tensions are high and it looks like it’ll all boil over when Maria Ruiz (Jessica Pimentel) comes for Piper.
What is Maria upset about?
Is she why Piper Chapman ( Taylor Schilling ) feels unsafe (“I’ve been in Litchfield for a while now.
And I’ve started to feel unsafe lately,” she says earlier in the trailer)?
Is leading up to the image of Piper getting held down in the kitchen ( below )?
We have so many questions !

“I went there,
bought a house, moved in, b**ch.
And now, I’m remodeling the kitchen.”
But the showdown doesn’t appear limited to Piper, as Cindy Hayes
(Adrienne Moore) confronts a new, Islamic inmate in her sleeping area.
6.
“You know the
difference between pain and suffering?
Pain’s always there but suffering is a
choice.”
Pennsatucky ( Taryn Manning ) has some choice words for her
new friend, Big Boo (Lea DeLaria).
Is she referring to her sexual assault by a
correctional officer last season?
Or is there something deeper going on with
her?
We love these two together, but Pennsatucky’s words are too ominous for
comfort!
