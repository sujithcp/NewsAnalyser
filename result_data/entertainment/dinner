So, it only seems right that they share in the glory (and criticism) that comes with parenting in the spotlight, or at least Legend, 37, thinks so.
“Funny there’s no dad-shaming.
When both of us go out to dinner, shame both of us so Chrissy doesn’t have to take it all.
We’ll split it,” the singer tweeted on Tuesday, referencing a recent outing the couple had that triggered backlash.
The model, 30, caught some criticism when she went out for dinner with Legend shortly after giving birth to her daughter.
In true Teigen fashion, the Lip Sync Battle star responded to her critics by screenshotting their comments and sharing them on Twitter.
“I went to dinner.
People are pissed.
Good morning!” she tweeted, quoting one of her commenters in a separate tweet, “‘I never wanted to leave my daughter, I love her, BUT THAT’S JUST ME’ – the passive aggressiveness is real!”
She might not need it, but it’s certainly clear, Legend’s got his wife’s back.
