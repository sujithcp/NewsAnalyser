"She's a Hollywood icon with a Nobel Prize.
She got a genius brain and bangin' thighs."
You wouldn't think getting a date would be hard for a glamorous Hollywood sex symbol like Sharon Stone.
But James Corden revealed on Thursday night's Late Late Show that the 58-year-old mother of three is struggling to find companionship, so he did what any proper late-night host would do: He wrote an original rap song called "Wanna Date Her?"
Seated on a throne draped with her white fur coat while wearing a crown, a low-cut black top and red leggings, Stone smiled along as the host ticked off her credentials in verse.
"She's a Hollywood icon with a Nobel Prize.
She got a genius brain and bangin' thighs," rapped Corden, alternating between a dollar-splashed jacket topped with a red Kangol and a black leather coat paired with gold chains.
"None of her instincts are basic.
Bitches better bow down.
She's a Buddhist babe that burns the game to the ground."
While Stone stayed busy spraying diamonds all over the set, when Corden asked what her name was, she got a bit Madonna on him and growled: "It's Sharon Stone, bitch."
