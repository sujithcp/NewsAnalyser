VIJAYAWADA: A new local talent came to light when Kalluri Srinivas, son and disciple of veteran vainik Lakshmi Sooramma, a pleasing vocal concert for Swara Tarangini Sabha of Vijayawada at Sri Sringeri Peetha Paripalitha Sivaramakrishna Kshetram.
Srinivas gave a pleasant surprise with a sumptuous and traditional vocal concert.
He sports a robust voice and his singing style was neat.
Srinivas started the concert with a briskly rendered Saveri varnam and followed it up with Sidhi Vinayakam of Dikshitar in Shanmukhapriya, finishing the kirtana with some crisp kalpanaswaras.
Next he sang the soulful composition of Thyagaraja Ennadu Joothuno in Bindumalini.
After this Srinivas delineated Sriranjani presenting a fine portrait of the raga and rendered Sogasuga mridanga talamu of Thyagaraja finishing the kirtana with good kalpanaswaras.
After singing Patnamâ€™s Garudagamana in Nagaswaravali, Srinivas rendered as the main item of the concert, a neat ragam, tanam, pallavi in Pantuvarali set to trisra triputa talam, the lyric of the pallavi being Satsangatame Jeevamu, Sakala Srishti Layalaku .
Squeezing in so many words in a narrow talam like trisra triputa did not give much scope to raga part in the pallavi both in the poorvangam and uttarangam.
However, the initial raga delineation was fine with rich raga bhava and attractive swarakalpana.
Violin support for the concert was provided by Ganduri Srinivasa Murthy admirably.
His solo versions of Sriranjani and Pantuvarali were melodious.
The pallavi was followed by thunderous tani by the percussionists Kandula Anil Kumar on mridangam and S.Hanumanta Rao on the ghatam.
Srinivas closed the concert with Jagadodharana in Kafi and a tillana in Khamas.
