Season two will feature appearances by Nick Cannon, NBA pro Russell Westbrook, record producer DJ Khaled and more.
Velocity, the Discovery Communications-owned men's cable network that focused on automotive-themed programming, has renewed celebrity car series Unique Rides for a second season.
The show centers on New York-based automotive designer Will Castro and his crew, dubbed Team Unique, who turn ordinary vehicles into one-of-a-kind custom rides.
In the upcoming season, Castro and his crew will customize vehicles for celebrities including NBA pro Russell Westbrook, record producer DJ Khaled, actor/rapper/comedian/television personality Nick Cannon, actor Erik Estrada and rappers French Montana, Remy Ma and Fat Joe.
Season two is set to premiere in the fourth quarter of this year.
"In February, Unique Rides became one of Velocity's most celebrated original series," said Robert Scanlon, general manager of Velocity and Automotive Content.
"Viewers enjoy watching the eclectic choices Will's clients make and how those choices not only push the boundaries of what cars look and feel like but how they push the talents of Will and his team of master craftsmen.
We can't wait to see how Team Unique transforms the wishes of a new crop of celebrities into the newest, most incredible vehicles on the planet."
The first season of the show found Castro and Co. customizing vehicles for stars including NFL receiver Odell Beckham Jr., NBA all-star Carmelo Anthony and Busta Rhymes.
Unique Rides is produced for Velocity by Alkemy X. Justin B. Wineburgh is executive producer for Alkemy X, while David Lee is executive producer for Velocity.
