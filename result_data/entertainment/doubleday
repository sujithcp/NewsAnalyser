From the romantic ceremony to the party on the dance floor, ET got a special invite inside Kaitlin Doubleday's lavish nuptials.
"It was amazing," Doubleday gushed about the ceremony.
"Best night of my life!"
Doubleday married Devin Lucien on Friday night in an outdoor ceremony at the Ventana Inn and Spa in Big Sur, California, where the couple exchanged vows in front of friends and family under a flower-covered canopy.
Nearly 140 guests were in attendance for the nuptials, including some of Doubleday's Empire co-stars, Gabourey Sidibe and Rafael de la Fuente, as well as the show's co-creator, Lee Daniels.
"Big Sur is the most beautiful place that's in California," Doubleday explained.
"We're both L.A. people, so we wanted something destination but not too far and the Ventana is the most gorgeous place we could pick."
Doubleday wore a custom Mark Zunino Atelier dress for the "I do's" and later changed into a cocktail dress, also by Zunino, for the party.
"I needed classic and beautiful and then I need to wear something risque and fun, so I did both," she told ET.
"Mark Zunino made it from beginning to end.
It took months and meeting with him, and it was one of the most awesome processes of this wedding."
More than 1,000 candles lit the reception, which featured a taco bar.
The couple has been together for nearly four years after meeting through mutual friends.
They got engaged in Paris, France, last May.
Next week, the pair plans to jet set off to Greece for their honeymoon, packing plenty of memories from their special day to take with them.
"It's crazy to feel the love from the room and having people just tell you how they feel about you," Lucien told ET.
"It only kind of happens once.
This is the day that everyone tells us they love us," Doubleday added before joking, "They'll go back to hating us tomorrow."
