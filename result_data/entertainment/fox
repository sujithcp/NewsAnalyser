Ed Henry will be taking a break from Fox News following revelations of an ongoing extra-marital affair.
In Touch Weekly reports Henry had a 10-month relationship with a Las Vegas woman.
Their “investigation” includes “images of steamy text message exchanges, photos of their secret rendezvous and all the details inside their secret affair.”
“We recently became aware of Ed’s personal issues and he’s taking some time off to work things out,” a Fox News spokesperson says.
Henry has been with Fox News since 2011 , joining from CNN.
He is Chief White House correspondent for Fox, and has also been covering the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
