The couple married in December 2007 but split in March this year, with Fox saying that no third parties were involved.
Billie Piper and Laurence Fox have officially divorced after more than eight years of marriage.
A "decree nisi" was granted to Piper on the grounds of Fox's "unreasonable behaviour".
There were no further details given.
Neither party attended the brief hearing on Thursday morning at the Central Family Court in High Holborn, London.
Former pop singer Piper, 33, married Fox, 37, in December 2007 and they have two sons together - Winston, aged seven, and four-year-old Eugene.
But in March this year, a statement on Fox's official Facebook page confirmed the two had separated.
It read: "Laurence Fox and Billie Piper have separated.
"No third parties are involved.
"For the sake of our family we request and appeal for space and privacy at this time."
The marriage to Fox was Piper's second - she divorced radio and TV presenter Chris Evans in May 2007 after six years.
Piper's most famous role was as Rose Tyler, a companion to Dr Who from 2005 to 2006.
She also played Belle de Jour in the TV series Secret Diary Of A Call Girl.
Fox is best known for his leading role as Detective Inspector James Hathaway in the TV drama Lewis.
His father James is also an actor, best known for The Servant and Downton Abbey, while his uncle Edward and cousins Emilia and Freddie also act.
