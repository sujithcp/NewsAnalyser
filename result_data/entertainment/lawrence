With X-Men: Apocalypse headed to theaters later this month, the cast of the superhero epic is looking back at their time together over the past three X-Men films.
Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy recently sat down with ET's Carly Steel during a press junket for the action blockbuster, and the 25-year-old Joy star shared a funny story about her past relationship with Apocalypse co-star Nicholas Hoult .
"Nick always said whenever I yelled at him it was always in a Southern accent," shared Lawrence, who hails from Louisville, Kentucky.
"I find if I get angry, drunk, or really excited I get more Scottish," added McAvoy, a native Glaswegian.
"Oh, I used to yell at Nick and kind of see like his smile flickering," Lawrence recalled.
"[I was] like, 'Why are you smiling?'
And he's like, 'Because you sound like your dad.'"
Lawrence and Hoult dated while filming X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past .
The couple called it quits in August 2014 , but reportedly remained amicable after their split.
In the popular X-Men franchise, McAvoy stars as Professor Charles Xavier, the telepathic leader of the team of mutant superheroes.
Lawrence, however, stars as the deadly shapeshifter Mystique -- a role that required the Oscar winner to show quite a bit of (blue paint-covered) skin.
So what does Lawrence do to maintain her svelte Mystique physique ?
Apparently, it's all about understanding your metabolism and your limitations.
"I try to work out.
Then as you get older there's just certain things [you can't do]," she explained.
"You can't lay in bed and eat pizza anymore."
"She eats pizza on the treadmill now," McAvoy chimed in.
X-Men: Apocalypse , which also stars Michael Fassbender, Oscar Isaac, Olivia Munn , Rose Byrne, Evan Peters and Sophie Turner, hits theaters May 27.
