Johnson and his production company, Seven Bucks Productions, are working with director Jake Kasdan on the remake of the 1995 classic, in which Williams played one of his most memorable characters – a man trapped in a board game for 26 years.
As he prepares to produce and act in a reboot of Jumanji , Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has vowed to honor the original film's beloved star, the late Robin Williams.
"The love and respect I have for this man is boundless," Johnson wrote in a touching Instagram post .
"You have my word, we will honor his name and the character of Alan Parrish will stand alone and be forever immortalized in the world of Jumanji in an earnest and cool way.
I have an idea of what to do and I think his family will be proud."
Williams died at the age of 63 in 2014, but Johnson believes the Hollywood icon would give his blessing to the remake .
"I also think Robin is somewhere lookin' down and laughing, remembering the first time we met backstage and I (for the first time ever) was a starstruck bumbling idiot that couldn't even get my words out.
Idiot," the Ballers and Baywatch star continued.
"He literally calmed me down with that smile and laugh."
Due to commence filming in the fall, the 44-year-old Johnson teased that "cool casting announcements" should follow later this week.
"In the original movie there were three big roles.
In our new story there's now five.
Been so damn cool to see all my actor buddies push their projects aside so hopefully they can come play in our world," he wrote.
