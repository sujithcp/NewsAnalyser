New details have been revealed about JoJo Fletcher 's reign as The Bachelorette and there are some pretty cringeworthy dates ahead!
Each season of ABC's dating competition franchise attempts to be bigger and better than the last with unrealistic romantic moments, "surprise" guest stars, and an excess of batsh*t crazy contestants -- and it looks like this year we've reached the peak of reality dating delirium.
Season 12 of The Bachelorette kicks off Monday, May 23 and ABC's adjective-packed press release teases a number of "fun, exciting and exotic dates" for the 25-year old real estate developer and her army of suitors.
Bizarre highlights include firefighting boot camp, taking a dip in a random hot tub in the middle of some snow-covered woods, and a swimming date (with thousands of seals, natch!)
off the coast of Uruguay.
But the most outrageous outing of them all?
"In one of the wildest group dates, 12 unsuspecting guys are asked to share their sexual experiences in front of JoJo and a live audience," the release boasts.
(Who else already has a severe case of second-hand embarrassment?)
Outrageous dates aside, this Bachelorette journey is all about helping a "devastated" JoJo overcome her " shocking rejection from Bachelor Ben Higgins " last season.
The series is even bringing back former Bachelorettes Kaitlyn Bristowe, Desiree Hartsock Siegfried and Ali Fedotowsky in the season premiere to offer JoJo their advice on knowing the difference "between red hot chemistry and love" while on the search for her future husband.
JoJo's season of The Bachelorette premieres on Monday, May 23 at a special time from 9:01 to 11:00 p.m. p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
