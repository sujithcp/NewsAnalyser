Magic Mike actor Joe Manganiello will produce and star in a Morrissey-approved drama about a fan of The Smiths who plotted to hold a radio station hostage.
Shoplifters Of The World will focus on a fan's plot in 1988 to take over a radio station in Denver, hoping to force the DJ to play Smiths tracks on repeat.
Mangeniello – who has also starred in True Blood – will play one of the radio DJs in a fictionalised version of the real-life plot.
The film will be written by music documentary maker Stephen Kijak, who has secured the music rights to The Smiths' songs.
Morrissey has given his blessing to the film.
A deal has been cut allowing the movie to use The Smiths' tracks
Manganiello said: "Morrissey agreed to give us the catalogue for a nice, affordable fee.
“Well, it's not cheap, by any stretch of the imagination, but we have Morrissey's blessing to move forward with The Smiths project.
"I'm a huge The Smiths fan.
It's just really great to be afforded the opportunity to go out and tell stories that I'm really excited and passionate about, like that one.”
The young fan who wanted to take over the radio station was called James Kiss, who was upset over his favourite band’s split a year earlier.
He was going to hold station staff at gunpoint, but was forced to give himself up in the car park without being able to carry out his plan.
The film will imagine events as though Kiss went forward with the plot.
It will also be set in 1987, the year The Smiths split.
