Sources say the network was able to work out a reduced license fee for the procedural from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
One of CBS' veteran procedurals will be back to see another season.
The network has handed out a 12th season renewal for drama Criminal Minds, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
Meanwhile, the fate of spinoff Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders remains undetermined.
In its 11th season, Criminal Minds ranked as a top 10 drama in total viewers (12 million) and adults 18-49 (2.8 million).
The series, starring Joe Mantegna, Thomas Gibson, Matthew Gray Gubler, A.J.
Cook and Kirsten Vangsness, ranks as CBS' second-highest-rated drama in total viewers, adults under 50 and adults 25-54 (3.8 million).
The key to the renewal, sources tell THR , is that the network was able to work out a reduced license fee for the drama, a co-production between ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Exec producers include Erica Messer, Mark Gordon and Breen Frazier.
As networks continue to make ownership a higher priority, reducing license fees is becoming paramount for off-network and co-production series.
CBS is also in the midst of working out a potential new deal for freshman DC Comics drama Supergirl, which is produced by Warner Bros. Television.
Criminal Minds joins a roster of returning dramas at CBS including Blue Bloods, Elementary, Hawaii Five-0, Madam Secretary, NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS: New Orleans and Scorpion .
Still on the bubble are Beyond Borders and CSI: Cyber as well as Code Black, Limitless and Rush Hour .
Decisions on those are expected to come in the next couple weeks as broadcast networks prepare for their upfront presentation to Madison Avenue ad buyers in New York.
