After being in a relationship for six years, Sushant Singh Rajput and Ankita Lokhande have decided to call it quits.
The rumours about their break-up started doing the rounds a few months ago, but the two have remained tight-lipped about their personal matter.
However, Sushant has finally broken his silence on the issue and confirmed his break-up with Ankita on social media.
The 30-year-old actor took to Twitter to finally put an end to all speculations.
Sushant, who is currently shooting for Raabta with Kriti Sanon, said, "People grow apart and it's unfortunate.
Period!"
Though, the reason behind their break-up is still unknown.
Rumours had it that Sushant's closeness to his Shudh Desi Romance co-star Parineeti Chopra was one of the reason for them to move apart.
And even Ankita's chronic alcohol addition played its part in their break-up.
However, Sushant clarified that these were not the reasons behind their separation.
Earlier, buzz had it that Sushant had moved out of his Bandra residence.
A source was quoted as telling DNA , "The Bandra apartment that Sushant and Ankita lived in, belongs to her.
She asked him to move out.
Sushant had no choice but to do so.
So he moved far away from Ankita's radius to Juhu."
Ankita and Sushant fell in love on the sets of their TV show Pavitra Rishta.
They were to get married this December.
But with the latest twist in the tale, that seems impossible now.
