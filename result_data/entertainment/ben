And does Uncharted 4 live up to the hype?
Is it that time again already?!
Roll up, roll up and get your finest helpings of Ben Potter and myself as we bring you heaps of PlayStation happenings, hot discussions, and downright silliness via the Push Square Podcast .
This episode we have a great chat about What Titles Sony Are Making and what titles we can expect to be announced in the coming months.
Our super special guest this week is the Lord Protector of Push Square , Mr Sammy Barker , who joins us giddy as a school girl to talk about his Uncharted 4 review .
In my Indie Bin this week we talk about Severed , the colourful first-person dungeon crawler from DrinkBox Studios (the folks behind Guacamelee ) which is exclusive to Sony's handheld, the PlayStation Vita – listen in to see if it escapes The Bin or joins the rotting rubbish.
We round off the show, as always, with the great questions asked by you guys in our forum thread .
We love chatting to you guys and hearing your feedback about the 'cast, so please feel free to drop a comment in there or in the section below – let's chat!
