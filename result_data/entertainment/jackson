Hours after news broke that she was pregnant with her first child , Janet Jackson released the official music video for her single "Dammn Baby," and it's clear the pop diva hasn't lost a step.
Jackson, who turns 50 on May 16, shared the music video on Twitter, writing, "It's all about Love...
#DammnBaby."
Donning an all-black latex and leather ensemble and shot entirely in black-and-white, Jackson pulled off some wickedly skillful choreography along with a sizeable crew of back-up dancers.
"Dammn Baby" is the third song off Jackson's eleventh studio album, Unbreakable , released October 2015.
Earlier on Wednesday, a source confirmed to ET that Jackson and her husband, Wissam Al Mana, are expecting their first child.
Jackson, who tied the knot with Al Mana in 2012, recently announced that she was postponing her Unbreakable tour so she could focus on "planning our family."
