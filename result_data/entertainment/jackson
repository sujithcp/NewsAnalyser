Multiple outlets claim the singer, who turns 50 on May 16, is pregnant with her first child.
Entertainment Tonight was first to report the news, while a source told E!
News that Jackson is reportedly in her second trimester of pregnancy after successfully working with a fertility specialist.
Jackson previously sparked speculation she is expecting when she postponed her Unbreakable World Tour so she and her husband , Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana , 41, could focus on “planning our family,” she said in a video posted to Twitter in early April.
“We’re in the second leg of the tour, and there actually has been a sudden change,” Jackson said in the clip.
“I thought it was important that you be the first to know.
My husband and I are planning our family.
So I’m going to have to delay the tour.”
Jackson, whose new single “Dammn Baby” was released earlier this week, continued, “Please, if you can try and understand it’s important that I do this now.
I have to rest up, doctor’s orders.
I have not forgotten about you.
I will continue the tour as soon as I possibly can.”
The notoriously private couple wed in a secret ceremony in 2012.
A rep for Jackson did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.
