PDA-with-too-much-tongue alert!
Heather Locklear and Tommy Lee may have gone their separate ways more than 20 years ago, but that didn't stop the actress from celebrating what would have been the former couple's 30th anniversary by sharing a throwback kissing pic.

The 54-year-old Franklin & Bash star posted a black-and-white shot on Instagram of the pair locking lips, along with the caption, "Happy 30 years baby."
Locklear also shared a classic wedding image of the couple posing with Lee's Motley Crue bandmates Nikki Sixx and Vince Neil at their 1986 nuptials.
The lovebirds divorced in 1993 and Locklear went on to marry and have a daughter with rocker Richie Sambora, while Lee, 53, wed Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson and became a dad to two sons.
Lee is now engaged to singer Sofia Toufa, but it seems like he's still on good terms with Locklear, judging by the steamy shout-out.
Happy would-be anniversary guys!
