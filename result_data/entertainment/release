The BIGGEST clash of 2017 is already scripted and it seems that it is going to be BLOODY as hell!
Hrithik Roshan ‘s Kaabil , directed by Sanjay Gupta, has just hit the floors but they had revealed that they were planning to release the film on January 26, 2017.
They are just a few days into shoot and they might have got the shock of their life after Shah Rukh Khan and team Raees announced they are also going to release their film on January 26 next year.
But it seems that they aren’t intimidated one bit as they released the first look and the motion poster of the film last night confirming that they are also planning to release Kaabil along with Raees .
However, the graphics on the release date changes from white to BLOOD red signifying that it is going to be a huge battle at the box office.
The motion poster starts with a burning candle which was then focused in the eyes of Hrithik’s character, who is blind.
Then a text – The MIND sees all appears, followed by the Kaabil logo and the release date.
The film is a revenge drama and the teaser reveals that even though Hrithik is blind man, his mind is so strong that it will help him see and understand everything.
We will also see Yami Gautam in the film, who will tragically die and set of a chain reaction.
It is interesting to note that after Raees announced their release date, the makers of Kaabil released this teaser out of the blue, confirming the clash.
