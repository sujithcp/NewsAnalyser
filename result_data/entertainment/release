New Delhi, May 6 -- In 1999, soon after the Indian cricket team's home series against South Africa came to an end, the Delhi Police revealed that they had obtained evidence that pointed to match-fixing.
A few days after Delhi Police's revelation, South African cricketer Hansie Cronje admitted to having taken money from bookies to underperform, and also to influence other players.
In his admission, he also mentioned the names of Indian cricketers like Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Manoj Prabhakar and Ajay Sharma.
A sting operation was a major piece of evidence.
Azharuddin and Sharma were banned from playing cricket for life by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
However, in 2012, the Andhra Pradesh High Court lifted the ban on Azharuddin, calling it "unsustainable".
Now, the makers of Azhar, an upcoming film that is based on some of the true events that took place in Azharuddin's life, is trying to incorporate parts of that sting operation in the movie.
A source says, "Making a film on such a sensitive subject requires the accurate representation of facts.
Thus, the makers are looking at how they can use the real footage of the sting operation in the movie."
The film's director, Tony D'Souza, says, "We have recreated the sting operation in the film from the footage that is available.
But we're trying to get our legal team to figure out the process to insert parts of the real recording in the film."
