Bollywood’s love with Kolkata continues.
After Amitabh Bachchan’s TE3N, it’s now Ayushmann Khurrana and Parineeti Chopra’s turn to take Bollywood to the City of Joy: They are coming together for Yash Raj films’ production Meri Pyaari Bindu , the directorial debut of Akshay Roy.
On Thursday, both Ayushmann and Parineeti shared a sneak peak of what the film has to offer on their Twitter timelines.
It started with Parineeti tweeting a cryptic message in the morning, “It all begins in the city of joy!” Taking his cue, Ayushmann replied, “I love it when the Bindu in you says such things”.
The one-and-a-half-minute-long video starts with Abhimanyu (Ayushmann) writing a ‘horror’ story story on a typewriter.
The setting is a small bylane in Kolkata, and the horror story he’s writing sounds more sleazy than scary.
He pauses for a while and tells us that instead of writing his story, he’d rather talk about his ‘Bindu’.

“We are shooting in May.
The film is Meri Pyaari Bindu with Parineeti.
I am really excited about it.
I will be playing a Bengali for the first time,” Ayushmann had earlier said.
“The movie is a beautiful love story between Bindu and Ayushmann’s character, set in Kolkata.
It is going to be a beautiful, heart-wrenching love story,” added Parineeti.
Meri Pyari Bindu is produced by Maneesh Sharma and Yash Raj Films.
Shooting for the film began on Thursday.
