Danielle Fishel and husband Tim Belusko are together no more.
The Girl Meets World star filed for divorce late last year, right around the time of her two-year wedding anniversary.
An Orange County, California judge has signed off on the divorce, making Fishel and Belusko officially single on May 17.
Fishel first met Belusko, 27, when she was a student and tutoring at California State University, Fullerton.
After a few years of dating, the two got engaged in May 2012, and were tied the knot on Oct. 19, 2013 in Los Angeles.
Fishel's Girl Meets World co-star and onscreen husband , Ben Savage, was in attendance.
"It was a day we had planned for over year and while I expected it to be full of love, fun, and a day to remember, I could have never expected what that day actually turned out to be; truly mind-blowingly amazing," Fishel wrote on her blog a few days after her wedding.
"Itâ€™s so very rare to have that many people you love and appreciate in one room (weddings and funerals, sadly?)
but when those moments of pure joy are experienced, they are overwhelming."
Also this week, Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco finalized her divorce from tennis pro Ryan Sweeting, and she agreed to pay a pretty large sum in spousal support.
