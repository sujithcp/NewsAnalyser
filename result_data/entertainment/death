Bobby Brown has petitioned to become a plaintiff in the Bobbi Kristina wrongful death lawsuit against Nick Gordon.
Documents from Fulton County Court show that the 47-year-old singer was requested to be added as a plaintiff in the ongoing $10 million wrongful death civil lawsuit, which alleges that "Ms. Brown died due to a violent altercation with Defendant (Gordon) after which he placed her in a bathtub, unconscious, after he injected her with a toxic mixture."
On June 24, 2015, Bobbi Kristina's court-appointed conservator, Bedelia Hargrove, filed a $10 million wrongful death civil lawsuit against Gordon -- who was at the scene and had performed CPR on her before paramedics arrived -- accusing him of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and transferring money from Brown's account into his own without authorization.
No criminal charges have been filed against Gordon and his lawyers have called the wrongful death civil suit "slanderous and meritless."
The daughter of Brown and the late Whitney Houston was found unconscious in her bathtub on Jan. 31, 2015.
Bobbi Kristina died nearly seven months later, on July 26, 2015, at the age of 22.
