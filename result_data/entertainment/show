Today show host Natalie Morales will make a cross country move as she takes on the new role of West Coast anchor for the popular morning show, according to Deadline .
Along with hosting the same show from Los Angeles, Morales, 43, will also take on hosting roles at Access Hollywood and Access Hollywood Live .
News of Morales' big move came on the heels of reports that Billy Bush , 44, would be exiting Access Hollywood – where he's been a co-anchor since 2004 – to join Today .
In a memo from Today , obtained by Deadline , the show's SVP Noah Oppenheim announced the news to employees.
"I'm writing with excited news – this summer, Natalie Morales will move to LA to become Today 's West Coast Anchor… She'll continue to play a prominent role on Dateline ," Oppenheim wrote, also including her other two gigs.
"With our show's increasing focus on West Coast stories, it became clear to me that having a permanent anchor presence in LA would be of enormous value."
Morales first joined the morning show in 2006, beginning as a national correspondent before moving up to co-anchor in 2008.
