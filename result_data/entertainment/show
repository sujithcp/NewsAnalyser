The daytime talk show is already moving forward, and Strahan hasn't even left yet. 
 
 
A source close to the daytime talk show tells ET that the graphics have already been changed, and do not include Strahan's name.
They now say Live!
Kelly, but the show will be called Live!
With Kelly .
This is also how the ABC program was labeled when Regis Philbin left in 2011.
Strahan's final Live!
episode will be on Friday, May 13, after a four-year stint as Kelly Ripa's co-host.
Last week, a source close to the show told ET that Live!
producers were "still debating" how to handle Strahan's official sendoff.
"If it seems too celebratory, itâ€™ll seem disingenuous due to all the known drama," the source said.
This week, Ripa gave a candid interview with People , and expressed her concerns after learning that Strahan would be leaving Live!
for a full-time position at Good Morning America .
"I get it.
We're excited for Michael.
He wanted that job, and it's great for him.
I think it is a perfect match, I really do.
However, what nobody considered is there's a whole other group of people that it really impacts, because we have to now find another great person," she explained.
"I am fine, but I need assurances that we're all going to be fine."
Ahead of Thursday's show, Ripa stepped out in New York City wearing a jacket with the word "Freedom" printed on the back.
