It’s all about the gams!
Chrissy Teigen may have given birth to her baby daughter, Luna, less than three weeks ago, but the new mom is already back to her supermodel-esque figure.
On Tuesday, her mom, Vilailuck Teigen, posted several photos of Chrissy at a family event with her hubby, John Legend, and newborn baby.

The Sports Illustrated model wore jean shorts with gladiator sandals that showed off her endless stems.
She paired the look with an off-the-shoulder black shirt and wore her hair in a bun with minimal makeup.
The family enjoyed an outdoor meal under a beautiful canopy.
And obviously baby Luna was the hit of the day.
Vilailuck posted a pic of several ladies cooing over the little girl.
“Visiting Lulu #fablife,” she captioned the image.
Chrissy also shared a shot from the event, showing off the delicious crab feast on Instagram, writing, “The life!!
Having a crab boil at the casa!
Thank you,@chefdantecardone!”
Chrissy and John are already loving parenthood.
Last week Chrissy posted a picture of Luna’s first bath , writing, “bath time is tooooo cute!
my heart, it hurts.”
