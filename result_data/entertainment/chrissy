The singer and mother of two was blown away at the sight of fellow mama Chrissy Teigen wearing a crop topâ€”and she let her know it!
This all went down on Mother's Day after John Legend Instgrammed a photo of baby Luna 's mom making brunch in a white crop top and denim shorts.
"Okay, what?!"
Kelly quipped on Twitter .
"She just had a baby!
My train of thoughts.... #hateher #justkidding #kindofnotkidding #jealouslikeJonas"
Chrissy's taut tummy wasn't the only thing Kelly was admiring, though.
She responded to John's photo of some delicious looking "Mother's Day chacken" writing, " Yeah I'm not gonna like, that looks damn good!
You & @chrissyteigen r welcome 4 play dates if u bring that w/you ha!"
That would be one adorable playdate!
Kelly and hubby Brandon Blackstock , who have a 23-month-old daughter named River Rose together, welcomed son Remington Alexander on April 12.
Chrissy and John's baby Luna was born April 14.
All three kids are ridiculously cute, and we have a feeling Kelly, Brandon, Chrissy and John would have some fun amongst themselves, too.
