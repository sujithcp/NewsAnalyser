The icing on the cake.
âª Reporter: But with her nearly 50 years old, getting pregnant is challenging.
A spontaneous natural pregnancy in a 50-year-old woman is almost unheard of.
It's not that it never happens, but it's incredibly rare.
It's either the use of donor egg or the woman's own egg that she had frozen years before.

Did you have fertility treatments to try to get pregnant?
The main thing I did was tough, and that was to go on progesterone every month.

It minimizes the chance of miscarriage by 50%.

A hefty price tag for most American women.
In the United States, most of the assistive services like ivf, donor egg, are not covered by insurance.
Reporter: Janet Jackson has yet to comment on the reports of pregnancy and if so, how.
We may never know.
There's really not a lot that I or anyone else really knows.

Reporter: But they worry that women aren't hearing enough about the risk of taking drugs to stimulus their ovaries.
That's part of the procedure.
I would like to see clarity about what it means to go under it.
You are putting chemicals into your body.
There are risks.
Reporter: And if a woman can't carry her child, a surrogate may give hope.
This 40-year-old endured six rounds of ivf and two miscarriages with no luck.
