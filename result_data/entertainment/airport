Rapper 50 Cent has apologised for making fun of an airport janitor who has mild autism and deals with social anxiety.
The 40-year-old, whose real name is Curtis Jackson III, came under fire after he posted a video of himself on social media confronting Andrew Farrell at a Cincinnati airport and accusing him of being on drugs.
He later deleted the footage from his Instagram account after an online backlash.
"While the incident at the airport resulted from an unfortunate misunderstanding, I am truly sorry for offending the young man," the In Da Club singer told the NY Post in a statement.
"It was certainly not my intent to insult him or the disability community, which is a source of great strength in America.
I have apologised personally to him and his family."
The rapper says he did not mean to insult Andrew Farrell
In the video, the rapper can he heard ridiculing Mr Farrell as he follows him through the airport.
He says: "Look at him.
What kind of s*** do you think he took before he got to work today?
"He high as a m********** right here in the airport.
The new generation is crazy."
Mr Farrell's father, Ken, told WKRC the footage was "painful to watch" and felt like a "slap in the face".
His mother, Amanda, had demanded an apology from the star.
She told the TV station: "Personally, I think the guy was mad.
Andrew didn't know who he was right away and he ignored him and he did his job and went about his business.
"I think he was mad and offended that someone didn't flock to him."
