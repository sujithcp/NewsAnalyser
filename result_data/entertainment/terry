Wrestling icon Chyna's final TV appearance is still up in the air.
The former WWE star filmed an episode of E!’s hit plastic surgery docuseries Botched before her unexpected death at the age of 45 on April 20.
Chyna’s appearance was set to air on the show’s upcoming third season premiere, but Dr. Terry Dubrow tells ET he’s not sure what will happen now.
“We’re being very sensitive to what happened,” Terry said.
“We’re waiting for sort of the smoke the clear, but I can tell you that Chyna was wonderful.
She was going through a really good phase of her life when she was on Botched , and I think we helped her to get some places, but unfortunately things happen.”
Botched ’s new season is still set to premiere on May 10, but will likely not feature Chyna.
The star’s death is currently being investigated as a possible overdose , according to the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office.
ET was with Terry and his wife, The Real Housewives of Orange County star Heather Dubrow, for a happier occasion over the weekend: the launch party for their new book, Dr. and Mrs.
Guinea Pig Present The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to the Best Anti-Aging Treatments , now available for pre-order .
“It’s something we talked about it for so long,” Heather shared.
“Then we finally did it.
For us to do a project together, and really use all of our skills, Terry being a scientist and me being a consumer -- who are we kidding?
-- has been incredible.”
“It’s the coming together of what we know best, which is our love, our understanding of all things health, wellness and beauty,” Terry added.
“It’s really an opportunity for us to share everything we know with everybody, to help them from making a mistake with their health, wellness and beauty.”
ET was exclusively behind the scenes of the couple’s cover shoot for the new book earlier this year.
