Looks like you're missing a few buttons there, Justin Bieber!
The 22-year-old pop star didn't attend the Met Gala this year , but he did hit up an after-party at Up & Down nightclub in New York City on Monday evening.
Rocking a black suit and an almost completely unbuttoned white dress shirt, Bieber was snapped showing off his bare chest and his new shaved 'do .

Bieber was just one of the many celebs at the star-studded party, which also included Beyonce, Zendaya, Claire Danes, Diplo, La La Anthony, and her husband, NBA star Carmelo Anthony.
Many of Bieber's close pals were also in attendance, including Tyga, Hailey Baldwin, and singer Halsey.
There were no reported run-ins on Monday night between the "Sorry" singer and his ex, Selena Gomez, who did attend the Met Gala in a playful Louis Vuitton dress .
Gomez appeared to have her own private -- and much more low-key -- after-party, judging by this video she posted on Instagram of herself in jeans and listening to Spanish music with just a few close friends.
"How my after MET looks #partyof4," she captioned the post.
But no A-lister seemed to be having more fun than Beyonce on Monday night.
The "Formation" singer looked fierce at the gala in a nude latex Givenchy gown when she arrived sans husband Jay Z, hanging out with Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, her sister Solange, and even Rita Ora, despite all those "Becky with the good hair" rumors.
Watch the video below for more on Beyonce and Ora's friendly run-in.
