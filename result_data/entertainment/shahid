When not surprising his fans with his madcap, grungy act in Udta Punjab, Shahid Kapoor is busy pampering wife Mira.
The Bollywood actor and his wife, who are expecting their first child, are over the moon.
Shahid whisked Mira – who is in reportedly in her second trimester -- off for a babymoon and the loved-up couple cut a pretty picture when they returned to Mumbai on Monday.
The actor announced his impeding fatherhood with this quotable quote, to a reporter, a few days back, “Haan main baap banane wala hoon, tu kya kar lega?” But on Monday when he had a quick question-answer session with his fans, he was far chummier.
When someone asked if they have decided on a name for the baby, Shahid replied, “It is so difficult, suggestions welcome.” And how’s the state of mind of the parents-to-be?
Shahid answered, “Excited would be a huge understatement.”
We bring you excerpts from the chat and don’t miss out the fan who wants Shahid and Mira to be his parents!
