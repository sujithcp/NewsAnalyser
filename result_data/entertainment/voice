Whitney Houston, who was often referred to as "The Voice," will be making a posthumous visit to the NBC singing competition show of the same name.
A source confirms to ET that a hologram of Houston will appear on an episode of The Voice this season for a special performance.
The news comes after rumors began to swirl late last week that Christina Aguilera would be performing a tribute to the late singer on The Voice after photos and videos surfaced on social media of a glammed-up Aguilera seen singing with Houston's hologram on The Voice stage.
Aguilera was tight-lipped when ET asked about the rumored "duet" ahead of Monday's live episode of The Voice , though it is unclear when the performance will air.
"I am sworn to secrecy," she stressed.
"I can't say anything, but I'm very excited about the finale.
Very exciting things happening."
Last year, Hologram USA announced that they were organizing a world tour of Houston's hologram in conjunction with Pat Houston, the late GRAMMY winner's sister and president of her estate.
According to Rolling Stone , "the show will be interactive and feature the singer's greatest hits alongside as-yet-unannounced special guests."
The Voice finale airs Tuesday, May 24 on NBC.
