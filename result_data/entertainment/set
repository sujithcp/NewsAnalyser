The veteran actor will recur as a senior CIA agent in the rookie movie adaptation starring Ryan Phillippe.
USA Network has set its sights on Tom Sizemore.
The veteran actor has joined the NBCUniversal cabler's upcoming Shooter remake in a recurring role, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
Based on Stephen Hunter's best-selling novel Point of Impact and the 2007 Paramount feature that starred Mark Wahlberg, the series centers on Bob Lee Swagger (Ryan Phillippe), an off-the-grid former Marine sniper who is coaxed into action to thwart the killing of the president.
Ultimately double-crossed and framed for the attempt, he must call upon all the skills he acquired as a decorated sharpshooter to avoid capture while hunting down and exposing the traitors who set him up.
Sizemore will play Hugh Meachum, a senior CIA agent who is willing to do whatever necessary to advance his country's standing in an increasingly competitive global economy.
He joins a cast that also includes Omar Epps ( House ), Shantel VanSanten ( The Flash ) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson ( The Accountant ).
John Hlavin ( The Shield ) wrote the pilot and will executive produce alongside Wahlberg ( Boardwalk Empire , Ballers ) and his Closest to the Hole Productions, as well as Leverage Entertainment's Stephen Levinson ( Ballers ) and Lorenzo di Bonaventura ( Transformers ).
Simon Cellan Jones ( Ballers ) directed the pilot.
The 10-episode project, which is a co-production between Paramount Television and Universal Television, does not yet have a premiere date.
Sizemore, whose film credits include Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and Heat , has recently appeared on Fox's Lucifer and NBC's Law & Order: SVU.
He also is set to appear in Showtime's upcoming Twin Peaksrevival , set for 2017.
The actor is repped by DTLA Entertainment Group and Luber Roklin Entertainment.
