Tatiana Maslany is joining Taran Killam's hitmen comedy Why We're Killing Gunther as the female lead.
The Orphan Black star joins an ensemble of killers that includes Killam, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bobby Moynihan, Cobie Smulders, Kumail Nanjiani and Randall Park.
The story revolves around a group of eccentric international assassins who become fed up with Gunther, the world's greatest hitman, who also happens to be an arrogant show-off, and decide to kill him.
Their master plan, however, quickly turns into a series of embarrassing encounters, as Gunther always appears one step ahead of them.
Killam also wrote the script.
Kim Leadford, Ash Sarohia, Steve Squillante and Killam are producing, while StarStream Media is financing.
A June production start date is being eyed.
MadRiver Pictures is introducing the project to international buyers at the Cannes market, with UTA representing North American rights.
Maslany is well poised to tackle the role of a hitman.
Her Emmy-nominated turn on Orphan Black has her playing multiple cloned characters, several of the ass-kicking variety.
She is currently filming Boston Marathon bombing drama Stronger opposite Jake Gyllenhaal.
Maslany is repped by ICM Partners.
