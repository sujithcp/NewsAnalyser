 
Bipasha Basu is not impressed by your 'weird comments' on pictures from her honeymoon and would like you to 'get a life' - that means you, trolls.The 37-year-old actress is in the Maldives with husband Karan Singh Grover and interrupted her Instagram updates to post a stern rebuke to those who had left unwelcome comments on photos of the towel art in Bipasha's hotel room.
And no, she's not going to stop posting pictures.
