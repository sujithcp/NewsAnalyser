Bringing some heavy star power to the miniseries are Susan Sarandon and Murphy's frequent collaborator, Jessica Lange .
The two Oscar winners will star as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, respectively.
The first installment in the anthology series will focus on the infamous behind-the-scenes battle between the two powerhouses Hollywood's golden age who worked through their mutual hatred to create the critically acclaimed 1962 smash hit What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

The film went on to receive five Oscar nominations -- winning one for Best Costume Design -- and was a smash hit at the box office, revitalizing Davis and Crawford's waning careers.

Feud marks a reunion of sorts between the 50-year-old showrunner and Lange, who worked together on the first four seasons of American Horror Story .
Lange recused herself from the most recent season, American Horror Story: Hotel.
Alongside Lange, 67, and Sarandon, 69, Feud features a cast of acclaimed stars including Stanley Tucci, playing Warner Bros. studios head Jack Warner, and Alfred Molina as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
