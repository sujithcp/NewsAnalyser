Here’s an unconventional mommy support group: Jenny McCarthy, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi and Jenni “JWoww” Farley!
Jenny kicks off the conversation by asking, “Do you swear in front of your kids?” To which the former Jersey Shore stars simultaneously respond, “Yeah!”
“It is what it is,” Snooki adds.
“It’s not like you do it on purpose.”
Jenny agrees, then shares a surprising parenting trick she used on her now 13-year-old son, Evan, when she realized she might be cursing too much around him.
“I said, ‘Listen, my mom forgot to teach me not to swear,’” Jenny says.
“‘So, you are so lucky that I’m teaching you ahead of time not to swear.’ And he’s like, ‘Wow, that’s so sad that your mom never taught you that.’”
But the trick backfired a little when Jenny’s mom came over to her house for a visit.
“He goes, “Grandma, it’s so sad you never taught my mom how not to swear,’” Jenny continues.
“‘Cause it just comes out of my mouth!
My mom goes, ‘Thanks a lot!’”
The ladies agree, there’s no way of protecting your kids from cursing completely -- they’ll pick it up somewhere eventually.
“That’s like the first thing they can get into that’s kind of naughty,” Jenny notes.
“I used to swear in fifth grade,” Snooki interjects.
“No, sixth grade, ‘cause I thought it was cool.”
And that’s when a magic moment happens: Snooki drops an F-bomb while holding her 1-year-old daughter, Giovanna!
Snooki seems shocked for a minute, but then immediately starts cursing again.
You can see more of the group’s antics when the Mother’s Day episode of Snooki and JWoww: Moms With Attitude premieres Wednesday on Verizon’s go90 app.
