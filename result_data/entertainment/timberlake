By now you've probably caught Justin Timberlake's summery comeback tune "Can't Stop the Feeling"...at least once.
The official video for "Can't Stop the Feeling" features cameos from some well-known stars, from Anna Kendrick to James Corden, Gwen Stefani and Ron Funches.
But if you look closely, you'll spot someone not as familiar, but just as important...Timberlake's mom Lynn!
"Can't Stop the Feeling" is the pop star's first music in more than two years, and the first single on the Trolls soundtrack, which will be released Sept. 23 on RCA Records.
Timberlake voices the character of Branch in the Trolls film alongside Anna Kendrick, who plays Princess Poppy.
Watch the clip (again) below.
