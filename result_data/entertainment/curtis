Jamie Lee Curtis is opening up about her battle with opiate addiction.
"So, awaiting final toxicology, it has now been reported in the New York Times that Prince was toxic.
I can relate.
I was toxic too," Curtis wrote in a blog for the Huffington Post on Thursday.
"I too, waited anxiously for a prescription to be filled for the opiate I was secretly addicted to," continued Curtis.
"I too, took too many at once.
I too, sought to kill emotional and physical pain with pain killers.
Kill it.
Make it stop."
The Scream Queens actress, 57, went on to say she is "one of the lucky ones."
"I have been in recovery from opiate addiction for over 17 years," explained Curtis, adding that now it seems like "the governmental body, the AMA, the FDA and the media are starting to address the rampant epidemic of opiate addiction."
"There have been reclassifications and attempts at reigning in the overprescription of opiates," said Curtis, who explained that "most people who become addicted" like herself "do so after a prescription for a painkiller following a medical procedure."
"Once the phenomenon of craving sets in, it is often too late," she continued.
The star also revealed that she "[mourns] the passing of a great artist" and also "the passing of potential artists past and present, caught in this deadly vise."
Her piece then called for people to "work harder, look closer and do everything we can not to enable and in doing so, disable, our loved ones who are ill."
"This is what it sounds like when we all cry," said Curtis.
