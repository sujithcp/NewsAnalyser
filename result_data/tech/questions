Google Slides -- can it displace PowerPoint?
La GOOG hopes so, especially in education.
The new features -- currently rolling out on Android, iOS and the Web app -- aim to make slide presentations more interactive.
Audience members can ask questions and vote for which questions should get answered.
That should give the audience something useful to do with their smartphones, rather than Googling ways to kill boring presenters.

Do you know anyone who enjoys slideshows?
[Google] is nudging slideshow viewers to ask questions in near real-time.
... Then, in a...crowd-sourced model, the audience can vote [for] questions they want answered.
… Clearly the company wants Google Slides to compete better with...PowerPoint.
[It] has become, for better or worse, the standard for slide shows.
... Microsoft offers similar functionality in Office Mix .Slides Q&A is rolling out globally [now].
Presenters...will see a button in the Slides presenter view.
... On mobile, this feature will be behind the “audience tools” button.
...
This feature could make...the Q&A session after a presentation...more efficient.
… If all of this looks familiar [that’s] because Google once offered a tool called Moderator.
[But] it shut down in July 2015.
[It] offered a similar crowdsourced Q&A service.Public speaking can be intimidating.
... Take Shree Bose, for example.
... She’s met with President Obama twice...and has given talks across the globe.
But she still gets nervous.
… When Shree recently visited our New York office...we invited her to try a new feature:...Slides Q&A.
... During Shree’s talk, [the audience] submitted more than 170 questions.
… At the end of her talk, Shree...couldn’t possibly answer all 170.
...
So she sorted the questions based on audience votes.
Education is obviously one key market for Google.
Mary Jo Madda got to interview Bose— Survey Says :
Bose believes that the Q&A feature [has] implications for teaching practices.
[And] for students who may be afraid to ask for help.
… “As a student myself, I've definitely been lost and confused in class.
[Q&A] takes away the fear of asking questions.
... Other students who have up-voted your question are [undoubtedly] also confused.” … Only one question remains: Are PowerPoint...presentations still the best way to teach?Q&A is the feature i'd definitely use.
iWork < GoogleApps < MS Office.
Although with Q&A added, it's a functionality that engages audience.
I'm finally starting to understand how google [has a] better business model than microsoft at this point.
