Google is making its presentation tool more interactive.
The company introduced a new Q&A feature for Slides Wednesday, which allows audience members to ask questions while they watch presentations.
The new Q&A feature, now live on Slides' website, iOS and Android app, allows people to ask questions in real-time during presentations.
To use the new tool, presenters must choose to enable questions from within the presenter mode.
Once enabled, viewers can submit questions via a URL and vote on each other's questions.
The presenter can then view the questions and sort them by which have the most votes.
(You can see the feature in action in Google's video with one of its former Science Fair winners, here .)
Google says it expects the feature will make it easier for people to engage with their audience during presentations and will make people more comfortable asking questions.
If you're presenting from Slides from a computer, you can also now take advantage of a new " laser pointer " feature, which simulates a laser pointer by overlaying a red dot onto the screen.
Additionally, the Slides apps now support presenting via Chromecast, Airplay and Google Hangouts.
