Nintendo continues to lower the price floor for access to its vast ecosystem of dual-screen portable games.
The company announced today that it would start selling the slate-like Nintendo 2DS for $80 on May 20, along with a preinstalled copy of Mario Kart 7 .
The 2DS is definitely the bargain-basement option for getting access to the full library of 3DS (and backward-compatible original DS) games.
That has been the case since it launched at $130 in 2013 and dropped to $100 last summer .
That low price comes with some compromises compared to the traditional 3DS line, though, including a lack of stereoscopic 3D, a non-folding design with slightly uncomfortable button positioning, and a smaller screen than the "XL" line.
The 2DS also doesn't play the few games that require the "new 3DS" chipset .
Still, the 2DS is a pretty good deal compared to the $200 that Nintendo charges for a top-end New 3DS XL these days, and it comes in cheaper than even a $120 used 3DS from GameStop.
If you haven't taken the plunge on a Nintendo portable yet, $80 is a great price for getting access to over 500 3DS games, thousands of original DS games, and hundreds of downloadable Virtual Console titles from Nintendo's back catalog.
That list includes at least a few dozen games that are actually good (We recommend Super Mario 3D World , Animal Crossing: New Leaf , and Fire Emblem: Awakening just for starters).
Plus, we hear there's a new Pokemon game coming soon ...
