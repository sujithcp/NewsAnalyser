Back-seat drivers rejoice, Bentley has developed an Apple Watch app especially for you.
The Bentley Bentayga Apple Watch App is uniquely for people who find themselves being transported in Bentley's flagship SUV.
The app uses Bluetooth to sync with the vehicle's various systems and once a connection is made lets users adjust climate control and heating settings, reduce or increase the vigor of the seats' massage function and change the music on the infotainment system straight from their wrist.
Dan Whittaker, Director of Electrical and Electronics at Bentley said: "This new Apple Watch connectivity is another example of how we are constantly innovating in order to enhance the customer experience."
However, Bentayga drivers beware, the app also allows users to monitor real-time information such as how fast the car is currently travelling.
