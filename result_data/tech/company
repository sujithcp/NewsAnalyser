A session for students conducted by Purple Squirrel Eduventures
A dozen people gathered in a room and looked at each other uneasily.
They all held various positions of seniority at Purple Squirrel, an ed-tech company in Mumbai.
The company’s primary objective was to organize industrial visits — either day long workshops or week-long trips — for students of graduate colleges.
They had just been told that the company had just about Rs 3 crore left and they were burning a cool Rs 1.2 crore a month.
The company managed to get a bridge round in January.
To stem the burn, 40 staffers were asked to leave and several more resigned.
Fast forward to April and the company downed its shutters and bookmarked another failure in the ed-tech ecosystem.
The company raised about Rs 15 crore in its lifetime.
Not a lot in the current climate, but it was possibly one of those which was too early for its time.
Purple Squirrel was incubated at IIT-Bombay in September 2013.
It was founded by Aditya Gandhi and Sahiba Dhandhania.
They wanted to start a company which took students on industrial visits across the country.
They wanted to take students to companies where they would get a leg up when they finally graduated; help them learn skills that a college education would not give them.
“The long term plan was to get students placed in these companies and get a commission for headhunting.
But that was after it hit a critical mass,” said a former employee involved in business development.
With that idea, Gandhi sent a team of sales executives with brochures to talk to various colleges.
The sales executives tried to sell the idea to the professors and the student body.
So, every time the professor agreed, the students nixed it.
But despite that the company managed to make Rs 3 crore in the March quarter of 2015.
The company would find “reasonable accommodation” near the client and keep the costs low.
Encouraged by this Matrix decided to invest Rs 12 crore in April.
Sources said, Purple Squirrel was under pressure to achieve a target of Rs 30 crore by FY16.
To achieve this target, Purple Squirrel needed volume and quick.
It now started focusing on taking students to tourist destinations just to get them on board.
Most colleges usually tied up with travel agents for industrial visits and had a cost structure in mind,” said the employee.
These travel agents bought inventory in bulk from hotels in popular destinations, something Purple Squirrel couldn’t do as it didn’t have the volume.
To be competitive, Purple Squirrel had to burn its own cash.
Students got their parties but the music was not playing for Purple Squirrel anymore.
Matrix, sources said, had promised another round of investment in September if the company had hit the Rs 15-crore revenue mark.
The investors refused to take the lead on the round.
“The valuation of the company was too high; almost 15 times their revenue.
A down round was not on the table at the time,” said the managing director of a Mumbai-based VC firm Purple Squirrel approached multiple times.
The co-founders in their desperation to be relevant, sources said, started the hit and hope approach.
“And as soon as the development was done, it was launched without testing or a focus group.” But it wasn’t an idea that would bring revenue immediately.
“This was the time when we needed to tie up colleges on multi-year contracts and that’s where we hit another roadblock,” said another former employee.
Colleges wanted names of companies and when the students could travel there.
Most Fortune 500 companies, source said, had processes in place.
“Most who had a factory floor couldn’t guess what would happen in a year or six months in advance.
If they had a huge order, no one would be allowed inside,” said an employee part of the sales force.
Those companies who did agree didn’t pass muster with the colleges.
“All colleges want to put ‘our students visited Maruti or Wipro’ in their prospectus.
And in December, the founders called a meeting to brainstorm.
In January, it got a bridge round of about Rs 2 crore from its investors.
The layoffs came and founders got on a path to sell the company.
“Think about it, a tour operator, which makes crores in sending families to Europe will have to hand hold teenagers in vacation cities… it is laughable,” said an employee who quit after the bridge round.
The company, which held great promise was heading to a place where they were losing staff and had no way to make money.
It was March, it was exam season no industrial visit was possible.
There was no way to generate a sale and in April, the two founders decided to call it quits.
Business Standard tried to get in touch with Gandhi, but emails and text messages were unanswered.
Dipping sales, cash burn force the firm, which used to organise industrial visits for students of graduate college, to shut shop
