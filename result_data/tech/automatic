Mahindra & Mahindra that had launched three automatic variants of the XUV500 last year, has now added another automatic variant - W6 AT - to the lineup.
Priced at Rs 14.29 lakh (ex-showroom, Navi Mumbai), the new variant is now the most affordable automatic variant of the SUV.
The new variant has been made available at all Mahindra dealerships with immediate effect.
This is the same gearbox, second generation, 6-speed, that does duty in other automatic variants as well.
The company has sourced this transmission from AISIN, Japan.
Vivek Nayer, Chief Marketing Officer, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd. said, "The Automatic Transmission of the New Age XUV500 has resonated very well with our customers since we launched it in November 2015.
I am sure that the availability of the Automatic Transmission across variants and a range of price points will now render this technology more accessible to a larger base of customers and make the XUV500 a more attractive proposition amongst a wide spectrum of buyers.‚Äù
Since only the automatic gearbox has been added to the variant, the company has made no changes to the engine.
The Mahindra XUV500 W6 automatic continues to drive its power from the same 2.2-litre, four-cylinder mHawk diesel engine that develops 140bhp at 3750 and 320Nm between 1600-2800rpm.
Due to ban on sale of diesel cars above 2000cc, the vehicle is available in Delhi with the 1.99-litre instead of 2.2-litre.
