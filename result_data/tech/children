Islamic State (IS) has reportedly launched its first mobile app for children to teach them the Arabic alphabet and the vocabulary taught by it includes jihadist themes along with words like ‘tank’, ‘gun’ and ‘rocket’
The IS’s ‘Library of Zeal’ has released an application, titled Huroof, for teaching the Arabic alphabet to children on Android devices, TheLong War Journal reported.
The application was released through IS’s Telegram channels.
The journal posted several images of the app, which is brightly coloured and has the look and feel of a children’s application.
The alphabet application is not the Islamic State’s first mobile application, however it is the first to be directed exclusively at children.
The jihadist group has released several videos that show children being trained for jihad or indoctrinated in schools.
