Intel has announced that it is to cut 12,000 jobs, despite reporting first quarter revenues of $13.7bn, up 7% compared with the same period a year ago.
Profit was also up compared with the first quarter of 2015 at $2bn, an increase of 3%.
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the financial results show that Intel’s ongoing strategic transformation is “progressing well”.
He said this process will accelerate in 2016 as Intel evolves from a “PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices”.
The Intel security group was one of the best performers, with revenue of $537m, up 5% on the previous quarter and up 12% year-over-year.
Intel’s internet of things group recorded revenue of $651m, up 4% on the previous quarter and 22% compared with the same period a year ago.
The programmable solutions group reported revenue of $359m, excluding $99m of revenue as a result of acquisition-related adjustments.
Although the client computing group revenue of $7.5bn was down 14% on the previous quarter, it was up 2% year-over-year, and while the dataentre group revenue of $4bn was down 7% from the previous quarter, it was up 9% compared with the first quarter of 2015.
However, the non-volatile memory solutions group revenue of $557m was down 15% on the previous quarter and down 6% year-over-year.
Intel said strength in datacentre and internet of things groups’ revenue and a strong start for the programmable solutions group (formerly Altera) delivered $2.2bn in revenue growth and made up 40% of revenue, helping to offset the decline in the PC market and macro-economic challenges.
Despite Krzanich’s upbeat remarks about Intel’s transformation process, underlying that process is a restructuring plan that calls for cutting around 11% of Intel’s global workforce in the next year.
The announcement has raised concerns in Ireland, where Intel currently has over 5,000 employees , according to the Irish Independent .
Intel said it is too soon to say where the job cuts will be made, but the company estimates that the restructuring initiative will cost around $1.2bn.
It added that the job cuts would take place through site consolidations worldwide, a combination of voluntary and involuntary departures, and a re-evaluation of programs.
Intel said those affected by the cuts will be notified in the next two months.
It expects the restructuring plan to deliver $750m in savings in 2016 and annual run rate savings of $1.4bn by mid-2017.
