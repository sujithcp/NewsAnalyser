Tiger Global-backed Lybrate, that currently facilitates online consultation with doctors, has tied with leading diagnostic care service providers to offer lab testing facilities to its consumers.
The company claims that the offer creates a unique online-offline-online marketplace.
“ Lybrate is aiming to take convenience in healthcare delivery to a new level with the launch of the new product.
Integrated into online doctor consultation experience, the product equips users to book and get sample pick up from the location and time that best suit them, and proceed with the consultation process upon reports being automatically shared with them and their doctor,” says a company statement.
The facility of getting nearly 2,500 tests done is currently available in three cities— Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.
There are plans to add five more cities to the list in next three months.
“We came across the ‘offline’ gap in online doctor consultation that lab tests created, which broke the cycle of consultation.
Medical experts suggest that over 75% consultations require medical tests and because they involve either visiting a lab or making an extra effort to search a lab and book a test online, 70% people tend to ignore it, exposing their health to grave risk.
In a strategic business decision, we decided to include lab tests on our platform to enable users to take up recommended tests,” Saurabh Arora, Founder and CEO, Lybrate.
Medical app is Lybrate’s main product that offers, free interaction with doctors, paid consultation with specialists, audio and video calling facilities between doctors and patients and regular health feed on more than 400 topics.
The company claims that nearly 3 million apps have been downloaded since its launch in January 2015, making it one of the top medical apps in the country.
The company claims to have 100,000 doctors on board spread across 80 cities.
It boasts of monthly interactions of nearly 5 million.
Company officials say that nearly 10 per cent of such consultations are paid.
Currently, 60 per cent of its traffic come from metro cities.
Offering services in local languages is one of the options being considered to expand the reach.
