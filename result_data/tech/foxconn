Foxconn, Appleâ€™s biggest contract manufacturer, is in the final phases of scouting for land to set up a manufacturing plant, according to a report in the Economic Times .
Foxconn has been interested in locations in Maharashtra for over a year now.
The total cost of the project is about $10 billion.
The news means that iPhones could soon start to be made in Maharashtra.
The manufacturing facility that Foxconn is planning to set up, is reportedly exclusive only for Apple products.
The space needed for the unit is 1200 acres.
Two or three candidates for the space have been identified, and the deal is in the final round of negotiations.
Foxconn is in the process of finalising the deal with the Indian Government.
Maharashtra bagged the project after several other State Governments tried to attract Foxconn to their territory.
Once the land is obtained, it will take 18 months for the construction of the plant to be completed.
Foxconn has huge manufacturing plants in China, which had come under scrutiny for less than ideal working conditions for its thousands of workers.
Foxconn manufacturers products for Google, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Motorola, Dell and HP among others.
The move could lead to lower production costs.
A Made in India tag could attract more Indian customers to Apple products.
