Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm has launched its digital wallet service, JioMoney Wallet , for Indian consumers, following the introduction of 4G services to the public through an employee-driven invite system.
Jio has signed up more than 50,000 online merchants already for the wallet service, and could soon start supporting transactions on online marketplaces such as Flipkart, Amazon, and Snapdeal, a person familiar with the matter said.
JioMoney will also be accepted at thousands of offline stores across India.
JioMoney, available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, is the second application from Reliance Jio to go live after messaging app Jio Chat.
The wallet service will give Reliance Jio access to the Rs 350-crore and growing mobile wallet market in India.
The company had earlier won a payments bank licence in partnership with State Bank of India, which will help the telco accept deposits as well.
The wallet service has been made live for the public following four months of testing within the group.
Until now, the service was being used by Reliance Industries employees at company cafeterias and at the Reliance Retail unit.
The service will enable customers to make bill payments, mobile recharges and insurance premium payments, as well as do online shopping.
It also allows users to send and receive money to and from family and friends.
