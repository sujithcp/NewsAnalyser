The Honda BR-V is all set to launch in the Indian market tomorrow.
While engine specs and some of the features are already known, many are eagerly waiting for the most important aspect - price.
Variant-wise breakdown will also be something to look forward to.
The BR V is based on the same platform as the Amaze and the Mobilio.
While the front fascia of the car looks quite aggressive, the side profile is relatively calm.

The interiors of the BR-V are inspired by the new Amaze and the silver accents on an all-black theme look pleasing.
