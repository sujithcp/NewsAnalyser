#Jio
Jio 4G services had been soft launched for select group of Reliance employees back in December last year.
The commercial rollout is expected sometime in December this year.
However, Jio has started a referral program to let more users get an experience of the Jio boquet of services.
Current Jio users can invite up to 10 friends to try out Jio services by purchasing a LYF smartphone.
As part of this offer, users will get access to some premium Jio apps such as JioPlay, JioBeats, JioMags, JioNews and so on.
Eligible employees will get a mail from Jio with a ‘Refer Now’ button using which you can invite up to 10 friends who will then get a mail from LYF.
On receiving the mail from LYF, the referred friends need to take a print of the copy of the referral email.
One should take their original and copy of valid proof of address, proof of identity and passport size photo to the nearest Reliance Digital / DX Mini Store.
On submitting the documents and purchasing the LYF handset of their choice, referred users can then tele-verify within 5 days from the date of submission of the customer acquisition form to get the Jio Preview Offer.
Once the invite is sent, it will be valid only for 15 days.
Also the invite is non-transferable and will only work with LYF handsets.
