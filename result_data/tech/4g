All UK customer service calls made to EE will be handled in the UK and Ireland by the end of 2016, as part of the mobile operator’s plan to improve customer services.
The company, now part of BT Group, will create 600 jobs in the UK and Ireland, which will include more than 100 roles in Plymouth, south Wales and North Tyneside
by the end of June.
This will be when EE Pay Monthly customer calls will be handled onshore.
The locations of the remaining 500 jobs, providing service for EE Pay As You Go and Home customers, will be announced later.
“We’ve already seen a major boost in customer satisfaction by creating 1,400 services jobs here since 2014,” said Marc Allera, CEO at EE.
The improved customer service strategy includes taking 4G coverage to 95% of the UK’s landmass.
“For the average smartphone user, not-spots aren’t tolerated and 2G doesn’t deliver what they need.
Customers want 4G speeds everywhere they go, and mobile operators are too used to saying ‘no’ to new coverage.
“I’m saying ‘yes’, with an ambition to go further than any operator has ever gone, and with the ultimate aim of covering the whole UK with 4G,” said Allera.
EE said more than 750 sites will be built to reach UK-wide 4G coverage.
EE’s 4G coverage currently covers around 60% of UK and approximately 95% of the population.
When it was launched, 4G was used only for data connections and customers moved to 3G while on a call.
But EE is now rolling out 4G calling across the UK for voice and data over 4G.
The study collected 60,436,228 data points from 31,525 users.
The data showed that EE users have the best 4G coverage in the UK, with customers accessing 4G signals 60.6% of the time.
This compared with 57% on Vodafone, 56% on O2 and 39.8% on Three.
For speed, Three led with an average of 18.7Mbps, followed by EE at 17.8Mbps, O2 and 12.1Mbps and Vodafone at 11.8Mbps.
