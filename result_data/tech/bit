A light-up wearable gadget for children has been designed by one of the companies involved in making the BBC Micro Bit computer.
The Mover Kit, by Tech Will Save Us, has a ring of programmable colour-changing lights that can be made to respond to a variety of movements.
The company's co-founder Bethany Koby told the BBC's Chris Foxx that the Mover Kit and Micro Bit were aimed at different age groups.
