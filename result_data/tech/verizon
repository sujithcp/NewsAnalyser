Way back in December, rumors suggested that Lenovo's next big Motorola phone would go in a very different than ages past, including a metal chassis and a curious camera bump.
Well, those rumors just got some validation.
HellomotoHK has posted images of what appears to be both the next Moto X and its Droid-branded Verizon equivalent.
Sure enough, they hint at a flatter, metallic body with a more elaborate camera array -- are those dots on the side a clue to laser autofocusing?
There's also a fingerprint reader on the front, which puts the kibosh on the Pure Edition's front-facing stereo sound... sorry, folks.
As for what's inside?
That's less than clear, but supposed benchmarks from late last month hint that the top-end Motorola phone will carry a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM.
It's par for the course among 2016 Android flagships, then.
You might not have to wait long to see how accurate these leaks are, though, as Lenovo has been teasing the launch of new Motorola devices on June 9th.
The only question is whether or not you'll see this particular phone among them.
Although a high-end Moto seems like a good fit for that event, we won't be surprised if you see something else on stage (such as the next Moto G) in a month's time.

However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.
