TOI Tech | May 5, 2016, 12.51 PM ISTSearch giant Google seems all set to take on Microsoft PowerPoint.
The company is launching a new feature for Slides, its PowerPoint competitor.
Called Slides Q&A today, it aims to help speakers connect with their audience and collect real-time feedback.
"With a simple link displayed on a Slides presentation, audience members can submit questions from their phones, laptops, and tablets -- and vote on those they want answered the most," says Michael Frederick, Google Slides engineer in a blog post.
Google claims Slides Q&A makes it easy for presenters to interact with their audience without having to worry about mics or moderators.
Slides also helps them get their big ideas and stories on screen, without having to worry about wires or set up stress.
Google has also added two new features to Slide.
Slide users can now present their slides to a Hangout right from their iPhones or iPads.
This means with just phone or tablet and the Slides app, one can present to any screen using Chromecast, AirPlay or Hangouts.
The company has also introduced a new laser pointer on the web for those of who like presenting from a computer.
Google first tested the new feature during a presentation by Google Science Fair winner Shree Bose.
Her talk, which took place at the company's New York office, generated some 170 questions from 200 middle-school students.
