The Luxembourg Ministry of Defence (MoD) has agreed to help the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) beef up its disaster recovery capabilities through the creation of a Tier IV datacentre.
The Luxembourg-based NSPA is the executive body of the Nato Support and Procurement Organisation, and is on hand to oversee the organisation’s logistics and procurement activities on behalf of its constituent members.
The NSPA and Luxembourg MoD signed a five-year deal to officiate the project on 9 May 2016, which has been in the works since early 2015, the organisations confirmed.
Mike Lyden, general manager of NSPA, said the project has required huge amounts of preparatory work to get off the ground.
This is because of the high-levels of datacentre resiliency an organisation such as Nato requires.
“This project exemplifies the great support the Nato Support and Procurement Agency receives from host-nation Luxembourg, and is just one in a long line of co-operative projects, which we have developed together as Nato partners,” he added.
The Center for State Information Technology (CTIE) will also be advising on the site build, which will be used to backup NSPA’s information systems.
Étienne Schneider, the Luxembourg minister for Economy and Foreign Trade, said the project was evidence of the country’s commitment to investing in areas of defence that stand to benefit the wider economy.
“The establishment of a datacentre can support a key technology sector by providing NSPA with a highly secure backup IT,” he said.
