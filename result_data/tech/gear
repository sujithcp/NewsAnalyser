Samsung appears set to launch its Gear Fit 2 fitness band alongside
Wireless Gear IconX earphones, as the two wearables were briefly spotted
on the company's S Health website.
The Gear Fit 2 can be expected to be the successor of the Gear Fit which was launched back in 2014 by Samsung.
To
refresh, the Samsung Gear Fit was claimed as the "world's first" wearable device with a curved Super Amoled
touch display and was a fitness band.
It featured a 1.84-inch Super
Amoled display with a 432x128 pixel resolution and came with a
pedometer, heart rate monitor, and a sleep monitor.
A 210mAh battery
powered the Samsung Gear Fit, which gave a typical usage of 3 to 4 days
and up to 5 days with low usage.
The device measured in at
23.4x57.4x11.95 mm (body only) and weighed 27 grams.
The Gear Fit
also featured dust and water resistance IP67 certification.
Also on
board was Bluetooth 4.0 LE (low energy) wireless connectivity.
The Gear
Fit included an accelerometer and a gyroscope as well.
Samsung is
expected to introduce the Gear Fit 2 with bumped of innards and some new
features.
The Wireless Gear IconX earphones, on the other hand,
are expected to come in different colours.
The Wireless Gear IconX was
listed alongside the Smart Charm which can be considered as a new
accessory from Samsung.
We can expect Samsung to reveal more details
about the new products soon.
The brief listing was reported by a Bulgarian site and first picked up by Droid-Life.
