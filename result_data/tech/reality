Adobe Systems plans to leverage on the explosion in content and data, Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen tells Sudarshana Banerjee in an e-mail interview.
Edited excerpts:

People are consuming more content across more devices than ever before in our history, and we expect it all to be compelling, intuitive and personalised.
This has created one of the most disrupted business environments the industry has seen in recent times and companies need to focus on delivering great customer experiences to stay ahead.
We're defining this as the Experience Business era, and it is a massive opportunity for Adobe with our leadership in both content and data.
As customer experiences continue to evolve, trends like virtual reality that push the boundaries of our imagination and enhance experiences will enable entirely new business models and customer relationships that we are only glimpsing today.
On working with US President Barack Obama's management advisory board
It has been a privilege to serve as a member of President Obama's Management Advisory Board, which was established in 2010 to advise on best practices for the federal government's management and operation.

There is no issue too big or small for us to tackle.
Indians have a unique entrepreneurial spirit and an immense amount of talent, both those individuals who have come to the US and those still in India.
My advice to entrepreneurs is to never stop believing in what is possible and thinking big, even when failure hits.
Failures pave the road to success, as many say in the Silicon Valley.
