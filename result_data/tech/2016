It was first launched in India in 1998 Hyundai sold 18.95 lakh units of the Santro Apparently a new model is being developed in South Korea
Hyundai Santro , the Korean automaker's popular hatchback, bid farewell to India in 2014 .
However, a report on the interweb claims that Hyundai intends to bring back the car.
The Santro that marked the Hyundai's entry in India first arrived here in 1998 and was an instant success.
The carmaker discontinued Santro's production after 16 years since it believed that the vehicle had reached the end of its life cycle.
According to an ETAuto report, sources claim that a new model of the Santro is in the works in South Korea and is scheduled to arrive in India in two years.
It further added that the decision to revive the Santro brand was influenced by the fact that customers continued to express interest in the car even two years since it was discontinued.
Apparently Hyundai's dealers have fielded lingering questions from customers about why the Santro was discontinued.
The Hyundai Santro always found itself among the brand's top-sellers; 13.6 lakh units of the car were sold in India.
Additionally, 5.35 lakh units of the Santro were exported during the hatchback's existence here.
That is a total of 18.95 lakh units of the car retailed during its lifetime.
Interestingly, a Hyundai India official denied there being any truth to the report and added that the company currently has no plans to bring back the Santro.
