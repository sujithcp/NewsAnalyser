Apart from the gigantic Mi Max , Xiaomi also announced three new accessories.
One of them is a successor to the currently available Mi Band called the Mi Band 2 fitness tracker cum smartwatch.
The second is a health-oriented accessory called iHealth launched for CNY 399 (approximately Rs 4,000) and the third, a slimmer 10,000mAh Mi Power Bank priced at CNY 149 (approximately Rs 1,500).
The details about all the accessories are scarce as the event focused mainly on the launch of the Mi Max phablet.
Xiaomi founder showcased the much-awaited Mi Band 2 on stage but few details about the wearable were revealed.
For the first time Xiaomi wearable features a display and is expected to reduce its dependence on a connected smartphone.
Owners will now no longer need to carry their smartphones along while jogging, or carrying out other fitness activities.
The iHealth box will let users measure things that a smartband cannot.
These would include deeper health-related metrics like the blood pressure, heart rate and more.
It packs in a 4.3-inch display and will connect via Wi-Fi.
Lastly, there was also a slimmer version of the 10,000mAh Mi Power Bank that is just 12.6mm thick.
The power bank features one USB Type-C port that can be used to charge the battery itself or a phone.
It also includes a standard USB port along with LED power level indicator and the power button.
