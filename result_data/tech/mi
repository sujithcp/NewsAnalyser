Xiaomi has confirmed that the Mi Band 2 has been delayed by a month.
The
news was confirmed by Xiaomi CEO Jun Lei via a Weibo post.
Lei gave
reasons that manufacturing the Mi Band 2 was difficult and it would be
released a month late - it was scheduled to be launched on May 10.
In
his Weibo post ,
Lei wrote, "Mi bracelet 2 production more difficult, it is estimated to
be released one month later."
Xiaomi's Mi Band 2 is expected to
sport a display which will be a highlight feature and will be the
biggest improvement over the older generation.
The next-generation Mi
Band is expected to reduce the wearable's dependence on the connected
smartphone apart from featuring a small display.
As rumoured, the
display on the Mi Band 2 will show the time alongside other fitness related details.
In an earlier
leaked image, the display of the wearable was also seen showing the
battery status of the wearable.

Xiaomi had announced it would unveil the new Mi Max smartphone running the new MIUI 8
version at its May 10 event.
The Chinese company had also confirmed that
the Mi Band 2 would also be revealed at the same day.
However, it looks
like the event will only have the Mi Max phablet and the next version
of MIUI ROM which will be seen running on the smartphone - which is
expected to be the platform lead device of MIUI 8.
