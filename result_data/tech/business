The Royal Bank of Scotland says difficulties in creating an IT platform for the businesses it agreed to split off as part of its taxpayer-funded bailout mean it could miss the EU-imposed deadline.
RBS had to divest part of its business, creating a new standalone bank, after the bailout was agreed.
This part of the organisation, which includes hundreds of RBS branches, is known as Williams & Glyn.
An EU ruling states that it must sell its full holding in the business by the end of 2017.
“As a result of this analysis, we have concluded that there is a significant risk that the separation and divestment to which we are committed will not be achieved by 31 December 2017,” the bank said in a statement.
Complexities are making it difficult to create a banking system for the proposed new bank, RBS said.
“Due to the complexities of Williams & Glyn’s customer and product mix, the programme to create a cloned banking platform continues to be very challenging and the timetable to achieve separation is uncertain,” it added.
The bank said it is looking at other ways to split the business and admitted that the cost of doing so will be higher than originally planned.
Lloyds Banking Group was also forced to split its business, and TSB was formed under the codename Project Verde.
TSB later launched alone with five million customers, eight million accounts, 8,000 staff and 632 branches.
Separately, RBS reported a loss of almost £1bn for its first financial quarter of 2016.
