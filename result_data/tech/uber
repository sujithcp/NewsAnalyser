Car-booking service Uber has appointed a former vice-president of the European Commission to its new public policy board.
Nellie Kroes spent 11 years with the European Union's executive body as commissioner for competition and also head of its Digital Agenda initiative.
The board will advise the company on its global expansion and held its first meeting earlier this week.
