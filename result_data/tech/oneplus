OnePlus 3 is slowly being caught in the rumour mill.
The latest leak
tips that the next OnePlus flagship smartphone will pack an improved and
bigger battery than its predecessor.
The new details come from
China and claim that the OnePlus 3 will pack a 3500mAh battery, which if
true, will be bigger than the 3300mAh battery on the OnePlus 2 .
Another battery
improvement was tipped in a recent leak that claimed OnePlus 3 may
feature 'Dash Charge' , which was rumoured to be the company's own fast charging technology.
The feature was to be the company's take on Oppo's VOOC, Qualcomm's
Quick Charge, and Samsung's Fast Charge technology.
It is worth noting
that the OnePlus 2, touted as '2016 Flagship killer', although being
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, missed out on
Qualcomm's Quick Charge feature.
According to the new leak, the
OnePlus 3 will come in two RAM and storage models - 4GB of RAM with 32GB
inbuilt storage priced at $308, and another 6GB of RAM and 64GB inbuilt
storage priced at $385.
The new leaked details from China also hint
that OnePlus may reveal a 128GB storage model of the OnePlus 3 flagship.
However, there are no pricing details for the massive storage model as
of now.
The new leak courtesy MyDrivers also
suggests other innards of the handset including a 5.5-inch full-HD
display, a Snapdragon 820 SoC, a 16-megapixel rear camera, and an
8-megapixel front camera.
The Chinese company has already revealed that it has been working on its third flagship smartphone for months
now, which Co-Founder Carl Pei claimed will sport a "new design," and is
expected to launch in the second quarter of this year.
