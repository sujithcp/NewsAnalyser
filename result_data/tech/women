Computer Weekly is pleased to announce the latest additions to its Most Influential Women in UK IT Hall of Fame.
The recognition provided by the Hall of Fame allows Computer Weekly to shine a light on those women who have appeared prominently on the list each year.
This offers the judges the opportunity to introduce new entrants to the top 50 list as emerging role models.
This year, our expert judges recommended that past winners of the Most Influential Women in UK IT list should take a place in the Hall of Fame.
From now on, everyone who tops the list will automatically be entered into the Hall of Fame.
We are proud to recognise the lifelong achievements of the four new additions to the Hall of Fame:
De Rojas was chosen in 2015 due to her constant work promoting women in IT.
She said she was “surprised” to have won, and promised to use the title as a platform to encourage other women to enter the tech sector.
She has a long history of working for software companies, including roles as vice-president and UK and Ireland general manager for CA Technologies, vice-president of UK and Ireland for McAfee and executive consultant for Novell.
Held up as a leader and influencer, De Rojas has led many transformation projects among the teams she has worked in.
She promotes women in the IT industry by acting in roles such as non-executive director for the Home Retail Group, advisor to the board of Digital Leaders and Everywoman Club member.
In May 2015, Shields was appointed Parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) due to her background advising startups and promoting digital adoption, and acts as the UK minister for internet safety and security.
Formerly the CEO of accelerator programme Tech City, Shields founded not for profit WeProtect.org in 2013 to wipe out online child abuse and exploitation.
At the time, Moran was the CIO for Thomson Reuters, where she actively participated in the Thomson Reuters Women’s Network, Women in Technology International and the National Center for Women in Technology.
