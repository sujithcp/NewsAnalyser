My god, I thought this was "Mac"Rumours, not TrollCentral...
The amount of uneducated BS vitriol being spewed here lately is mind-numbing...
This is a big deal, as SAP is widely used by multiple organizations of varying sizes, including IBM.
A partnership here can only propel the iOS platform in enterprise to even more expansive heights than it already is, and also help to accelerate iPad adoption in enterprise.
The only BS here is the trash being spewed by those sitting behind their keyboards pretending to be some kind of cyber columnist or warrior against the vile of Tim Cook, pathetic.
Vitriolic post bemoaning vitriol:rolleyes: On topic: It's good to see Apple trying to make enterprise a viable part of it's growth strategy for the future.
It's especially encouraging for iPads since that category needs a boost like no other in Apple's stable.
Hopefully, this enterprise push isn't a day late/dollar short.
