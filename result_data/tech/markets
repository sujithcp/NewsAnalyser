In a chat with ET Now , Stefan Scheurer, Senior Strategist, Global Capital Markets & Thematic Research, Allianz GI, says more than Brexit expects higher volatility to come from the Fed policy .
Edited excerpts ET Now: Talking about Brexit and what it may mean for inflows into countries like India.
If a Brexit does happen, would that mean catastrophe for world equities?
Stefan Scheurer: As a house more or less we do not see any Brexit and this is actually reflected in the recent polls in UK that says it is more or less in favour of staying within the Euro zone.
Therefore we do not expect any Brexit but if there is still one, it will be more reflected in the trade numbers than in the equity numbers.
Nevertheless, we still have to expect high volatility but the higher volatility may come also from the Fed policy instead of Brexit.
The Fed decision will take hold one week before Brexit, so this could lead to uncertainty in the market and therefore higher volatility all around the globe.
ET Now: In the runup to that vote on Brexit, could flows for markets by and large ebb a bit because certain emerging markets have received quite a bit of inflows.
India for example, got almost $4.5 billion in the last couple of months.
Can that inflow for certain emerging markets ebb in the run-up to that vote?
Stefan Scheurer: Indeed.
We have seen it actually.
By the end of February, when this kind of inflows started rising in emerging markets (EM) globally, especially in the bond side or in the bond markets than in the equity markets.
After four to six weeks, this kind of flood is more or less ebbing.
Therefore, we can expect flows to turn back to the developed markets ahead of a Brexit, ahead of a Fed meeting.
ET Now: What is your view on all the uncertainty going on in the globe right now and uncertainty over Fed rate hikes?
There is still the looming event of a Brexit whether it happens or not and then of course the volatility in terms of news flow from BoJ as well as the Chinese economic data.
Where do you think the global equities are headed in the near term or the medium term per se?
Stefan Scheurer: Actually for 2016, it is going to be a volatile market as we have seen so far since the start of the year.
Allianz Global Investors still expects two more rate hikes.
That means the probability of a June rate hike is increasing for us.
It is still valid as we are, growing globally and the potential for getting better numbers out of the US in terms of the labour market , in terms of the housing market , are all quite supportive, constructive.
You also mentioned that for the Bank of Japan actually this is the opposite direction.
Structurally there are lots of problems going on.
There is a question mark on Abenomics and therefore uncertainties regarding the structural issues.
The monetary issues are very important and uncertainties over what the Bank of Japan will do coming end of May when the G-7 meeting takes place in Japan.
So we expect more out of the Bank of Japan but also expect more from China going forward.
Therefore, we think the volatility will persist in global markets and will actually lead to global flows.
ET Now: The recent economic data from both Britain and China has not been that great.
Today we are waiting for some crucial services data and as I understood, that is a large portion of the Chinese GDP as well.
How important is the data that comes out today and will it have a telling impact on the way the Chinese markets react?
Stefan Scheurer: Actually, currently every data out of the Chinese market is important and the people are watching it very closely.
But generally speaking and over time in trend term speaking, the economy is slowing, the momentum is slowing.
We currently expect more or less a GDP growth which our tracker is highlighting at around 4.5 per cent than actually 6.7 per cent which gives you a clue about where the economy is heading to.
6.5-7 per cent seems for us really unsustainable and not achievable by the way.
Also after the Q1 figures, Q2, Q3 has to be 7.-7.5 per cent to have more or less a stable economic environment over there.
So therefore we are closely watching Chinese numbers because its volatility impact on the global markets, especially in Asia, has increased in the last few years.
