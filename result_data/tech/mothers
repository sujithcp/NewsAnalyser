'MomsShotOniPhone' helps people make a slideshow using a photo of their mothers and sharing it on their profiles.
Apple has teamed up with social networking giant Facebook to help netizens celebrate Mother's Day on Sunday by making a slideshow using a photo of their mothers and sharing it on their profiles.
The site 'MomsShotOniPhone' which Apple has created is fairly simple, with the users required to enter their first name and last initial, and then adding a photo of them with their mothers.
The language options include English, French, Spanish, Portugese, German, Italian and Turkish.
In the end, after approving a preview of the rolling slideshow, a one-click option is made available to post it to the user's Facebook account.
Once it is posted to the Facebook feed, it can be watched as a soft music bed plays and mothers from various Apple fans fade in and out of the frame just before ending with the image that has been uploaded and a Happy Mother's Day greeting from the user to his or her mother.
However, the fine print makes the user surrender those rights to the cherished family photograph.
"By submitting a photograph or video ('Content'), you grant Apple Inc. the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to incorporate such Content and your name into a video produced by Apple and to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt, and promote this Content, in whole or in part, on Facebook," read the Terms and Conditions.
