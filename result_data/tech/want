A Nintendo-themed line of Vans sneakers has mysteriously popped up online.
A European store listed the range that includes classic gaming icons like Zelda, Mario and Duck Hunt, adorning some of Vans' most popular styles (like the Old Skool ).
Not much else is known about the collaboration, and the listing seems to have been removed (though a cache of it can be found here ).
The only other info being the collection will likely go on sale in June, priced at around â‚¬65 ($75).
This isn't the first time we've seen Nintendo sneakers , but it's the first time we've seen them done in a way we'd actually want to wear.
More important than all that, is that we settle something.
Engadget Editor Nick Summers mistakenly thinks the Zelda-themed slip-ons are the best (bottom left).
When clearly the pixelated white pair (top right) are the ones you want?
Either way, whether you're team cool white, or club crazy carpet-patterned Zelda thingies, you can choose your stripes for real next month.
Of course, if they don't happen to end up in a store near you, you might want to make sure you've got your Instagram hashtag game down , as that could be your best plan B for snagging a pair.
