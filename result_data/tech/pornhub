Adult video site Pornhub is offering as much as $25,000 to hack its website and find flaws.

The bounties, which range from $50 to $25,000, are dependent upon the vulnerability reported and will be granted entirely at the discretion of Pornhub .
With this, Pornhub joins a number of technology giants that have recently implemented Bug Bounty programs, including DropBox , Google , Yahoo!, Twitter, Adobe and Twitter.
