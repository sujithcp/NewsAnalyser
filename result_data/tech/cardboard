Initially, Google's Cardboard virtual reality viewer was only available bundled with other products.
In March, Google started selling its Cardboard viewer, but only to customers in the U.S.
Now, the company expanded that to four more countries: Canada, the UK, France and Germany.
Cardboard, available through Google Store , costs $15 in the U.S., 20 CA$ in Canada, 15 pounds in the UK, and 20 euros in Germany and France.
The prices go down to 15 CA$, 10 pounds and 10 euros per Cardboard if you buy a pair.
Unfortunately, as Android Police noticed , only the most basic variant of Cardboard is available outside of the U.S, so forget about getting the Google Tech C1 Glass VR viewer and the Mattel View-Master VR Starter Kit in Canada or Europe.
For a complete overview of availability per country of various Google products, go here .
Google's Cardboard is one of the cheapest options if you want a smartphone-friendly VR headset, with support for most phones up to 6 inches in size.
It's definitely not the only option, however.
Samsung shipped a free Gear VR with each Galaxy S7/S7 Edge pre-order, Alcatel's Idol 4 phone has a box that doubles as a VR viewer, and LG showed us a prototype of its own virtual reality headset at this year's MWC in Barcelona.
