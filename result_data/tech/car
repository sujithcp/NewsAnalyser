A gold-plated customised car named 'Godzilla' that is worth $1 million has been put up on display at an ongoing auto event here.
Nissan R35 GT-R car, is being showcased by tuners and customisers of sports cars Kuhl Racing at Automechanika Dubai 2016.
The car is a result of a cooperate endeavour between Artis, Kuhl Racing and master engraver Takahiko Izawa.
The special gold paint sheen covers a 3.8 litre V6 twin turbo 545 hp engine, souped up with additional horsepower and additional torque.
The car features enhanced aerodynamic features, a reinforced body and precision handling.
Its engine is backed by an advanced paddle-shifted sequential 6-speed dual clutch transmission, which can be driver selected to shift at race car-like speeds.
The sequential-shifting transaxle features separate wet clutches for the odd (1,3,5) and even (2,4,6) gears and pre-selects the next highest and next lowest gear for quick shifts.
High performance differential oil, used in GT-R motorsports competition, is standard.
For 2016, the Nissan GT-R defends its position as one of the most striking supercars in the market today - with the addition of new 20-spoke wheels.
