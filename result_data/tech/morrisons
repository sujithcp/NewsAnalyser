Barsby will make the move to the supermarket brand in the autumn of 2016 to take on the role of chief technology director.
Trevor Strain, chief financial officer (CFO) at Morrisons, said: “We are delighted that Anna Barsby will be joining us to continue moving our technology function forward.
She brings a wealth of valuable experience which will be important for the ongoing improvement of Morrisons’ technology.”
Barsby has held many tech roles in retail, including project management at supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, head of infrastructure and service delivery at Whitbread and IT roles in TUI Travel, before moving to her role at Halfords in 2013.
As part of her role as CIO for Halfords, Barsby has taken part in some significant transformational projects, including a cloud migration from SAP-for-retail to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s Helion Managed Virtual Private Cloud.
In her role as chief technology director for Morrisons, Barsby will be taking over from current tech director Dan Beecham, who will return to Australia at the end of a three-year project.
During his time at Morrisons, Beecham ran a project to introduce and improve Morrisons’ in-store self-checkout systems
Strain said: “Dan has moved Morrisons’ technology forward, and the improvements that he and his team have introduced help us to serve our customers better.
His important contribution leaves Morrisons well placed for the future.”
