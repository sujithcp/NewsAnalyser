Earlier in the year, Eddy Cue, head of iTunes and Apple's senior VP of Internet software and services, stated that a new version of the media app will be released alongside OS X 10.11.4.
However, the new version, which is said to have a simpler design to make Apple Music easier to use, was not included in the said update.
A source, however, has sent Apple news website MacRumors screenshots of the upcoming iTunes 12.4 update, which reveal that the changes are coming soon.
The iTunes 12.4 update will be applying several tweaks to the user interface of iTunes, though it is not clear when the update will be pushed out.
Probably the most prominent of the user interface tweaks coming with iTunes 12.4 is the addition of a persistent sidebar to the left of the screen, which will provide easy access to different content.
The sidebar can be customized by users to show the content that they want, with users able to add to playlists shown in the sidebar by dragging songs to them.
The existing navigation icons that allow users to switch between content such as Music, TV Shows and Movies will be replaced by a dropdown menu.
Like the sidebar, the menu is customizable, which will allow users to hide the sections of iTunes that they do not use.
The iTunes 12.4 update will also simplify menus to make them easier to use, with the content in the user's Library able to be customized through the revamped View menu.
The app's mini player will also see a small tweak, with the Up Next song to be shown to the right of the player where it is more easily seen.
The changes to the user interface of iTunes comes as Apple is preparing to revamp its music streaming service, Apple Music.
One of the major changes coming to the app is its design, with a new black-and-white scheme with bigger and bolder text.
