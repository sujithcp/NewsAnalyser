Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt Ltd (HMSI) celebrated the momentous first anniversary of its adopted Traffic Park in South India at Goshamahal on Thursday.During the celebrations, Keita Muramatsu, President and CEO, HMSI said, “One year ago, when Honda decided to spread the message of safe riding in South India and adopt its first-traffic park down south, we partnered with Hyderabad Traffic Police and Administration.The high-penetration of two-wheelers in the city coupled with more and more women wanting to become independent riders, made us realise that Honda can contribute to make Hyderabad roads safer.
Today, it gives me great joy as we celebrate the first anniversary of Hyderabad Traffic-Park.“In just one year, Honda’s road safety instructors have educated over 7,000 Hyderabad citizens.
This includes over 500 females (who learnt how to become safe riding in just four hours) and more than 3,500 children.
The response has been phenomenal, right from new riders to females and children,” he added on the achievements.
