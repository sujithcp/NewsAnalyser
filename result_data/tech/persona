The game follows a ragtag group of high school students that feel like they don't have a place in society, but are drawn together by a common goal after discovering the Isekai-Navi.
Branding themselves the "Phantom Thieves of Hearts," they use the Isekai-Navi to enter the hearts of people and steal their malicious intent.
Also during the broadcast, Atlus aired a new trailer, which contained fresh footage and confirmed the release date.

Additionally, a Persona anime series called "The Day Breakers" was also announced, according to NeoGAF .
Persona 5 director Katsura Hashino previously said Atlus is "going with a challenge that fuses together a juvenile school setting that is as large as life, together with a picaresque romance."
"In the previous game, we wrote a story that involved having a justice group chase down a bad guy that could easily be feared by just about anyone," he said.
"This time, it's about a group of high school students that are being 'chased' by unexpected occurrences due to the justice they believe in.
We're writing [the story] to convey a thrilling everyday life in the shoes of these characters, that are as large as life, in this juvenile school setting."
