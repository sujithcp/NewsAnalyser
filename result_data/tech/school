Five smart Indian teenagers won a web contest conducted by Google India on browsing websites safely, the global search engine provider said on Wednesday.
"The competition witnessed several entries from across schools in the form of sketches, videos and apps and were judged on creativity, reach and impact," the Indian subsidiary of the Silicon Valley-based firm said in a statement here.
Mavika Boyini from NASR School, Hyderabad; Vaidehi Reddy, Army Public School, Pune; Kanish Chugh, DLF Public School, Ghaziabad; Raviteja Anumukonda, Chirec Public School, Hyderabad; and Neya Saravanarajan, the Hindu Senior Secondary School, Chennai, are the winners of the contest first launched in 2014.
The young minds were challenged to create their own online safety campaigns aimed at curbing cyber bullying and leaving a safe digital footprint.
Boyini sketched a set of cartoons and admonished peers to never post anything which their grandmother would not like, said the statement.
"Don't be rude, don't post inappropriate stuff and follow the grandma rule" are some her dos and don'ts.
Reddy cautioned internet users never to reveal home address, personal details and refrain from illegal downloads through a video, the statement said.
Chug developed an anti-phishing game to enlighten peers on how to spot fake logos, while Anumukonda talked about the need to avoid easy and predictable passwords to preferring complex unhackable ones.
Saravanarajan composed a catchy tune, Mr. Two Faces, to remind everyone to turn on privacy settings.
Google will gift all the winning students with chromebooks and tablets, the statement added.
