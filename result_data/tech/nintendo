News from Nintendo today, as the company announced that the Nintendo 2DS will drop in price to $80 starting on May 20.
The system launched in 2013, priced at $130.
The first price cut, in August 2015 , brought the system down to $100.
This will be the second price cut for the entry-level device.
The 2DS plays almost the entire library of Nintendo 3DS games, but of course without the 3D effect.
The system's standout feature is its design.
Unlike past models, this one does not have any hinges.
Nintendo says, "the unique design is built to make it easy for smaller hands to hold."
The price cut is for all 2DS systems, including the bundle that comes with Mario Kart 7 .

In addition to the price drop, Nintendo announced two new games today aimed at younger gamers: Style Savvy: Fashion Forward and Disney Magical World 2.
Fashion Forward, the latest entry in the Style Savvy series, launches on August 19.
The game includes more than 19,000 different articles of clothing, items, and accessories.
The game also includes Amiibo support, allowing players to access Nintendo character-themed clothing and accessories.
Note that the 2DS does not have built-in NFC-reading technology like the New 3DS does, though there is a reader accessory sold separately that allows this to work on the 2DS.
As for Magical World 2, the sequel takes players on adventures in six Disney-themed worlds, one of which is based on the popular animated movie "Frozen."
Some of the characters who will appear in the game include Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Ariel, Donald Duck and Daisy Duck.
Magical World 2 arrives on October 14.
The 2DS is considered part of the 3DS family, which has sold 58.85 million units as of March 31 .
However, there is no word on how many 2DS systems specifically have been sold.
