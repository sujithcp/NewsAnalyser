NEW DELHI: Honda Cars India Limited on Thursday launched its highly competitive compact SUV segment Honda BR-V in the national capital with a price tag of Rs 8.75 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).
The company plans to launch the car in Chennai on May 9 and thereafter will disclose the price.
The BR-V is available in both diesel and petrol fuel options in India.
Speaking on the occasion, Yoichiro Ueno, president and chief executive officer, Honda Cars India Limited said, “India is a key market for Honda and as part of our business expansion, we are focusing on increasing our customer base with new model introductions.
The launch of BR-V marks Honda’s entry into the popular compact SUV segment.”
The car design is modelled on the automaker’s ‘Active Solid Motion’ design tenet, and yet it evidently sports elements ‘inspired’ by the Honda Mobilio MPV.
The new model will compete with the likes of Hyundai Creta and Renault Duster, which are priced between Rs 8.46 lakh and Rs 14.5 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
The petrol variants of BR-V are priced between Rs 8.7 lakh and Rs 11.84 lakh while diesel ones are between Rs 9.9 lakh and Rs 12.9 lakh.
The automatic variant of the SUV is priced at Rs 11.99 lakh (all prices, ex-showroom Delhi).
