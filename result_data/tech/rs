iBall on Wednesday launched its first laptop CompBook, priced at Rs.
9,999, saying it expects to grow revenues by 30 per cent this fiscal as the technology firm expands product portfolio in the country.
The firm has partnered Microsoft and Intel for the laptop.
“The idea behind the product is to take technology to the masses.
In our research, we found sub-Rs.
10,000 was acceptable and affordable as well,” iBall Director and CEO Sandeep Parasrampuria told PTI.
He added the company will add 2-3 new models around Diwali to the sub-brand, iBall CompBook.
The Windows 10 operating system-powered laptops will be launched in two variants for consumers — 11.6-inch screen (Excelance) for Rs 9,999 and 14-inch (Exemplaire) screen for Rs.
13,999.
“We are looking at selling one lakh units,” he said, but declined to comment on the timeline for the same.
Parasrampuria said the target audience for the laptops will be the first time users who are looking at a computing device.
He added that iBall will look at tapping into the education sector with this product.
“Our revenues stood at about Rs 1,275 crore and this year, we expect to see a 30 per cent growth...
Segments like networking devices (routers) and security are doing well for us.
Laptops is a new category but we expect it to grow at a healthy pace,” he said.
Its other products include tablets, mobile phones and IT peripherals.
For business users, iBall CompBook Laptops will come with Windows 10 Pro and features like secure boot, domain join, bit locker and remote desktop with prices starting at Rs 19,999.
The laptops are backed by Intel quadcore processor, 2GB RAM and 32GB in-built storage (expandable up to 64GB).
