FRANKFURT: Europe's biggest software company, SAP is the subject of a USsecurity alert over a vulnerability the firm disabled six years ago that can still give outside attackers remote control over older SAP systems if the software is not properly patched.
SAP fixed the issue, but left the decision over whether to switch off an easy access setting up to its customers, who may sometimes place a higher priority on keeping their business-critical SAP systems running than on applying security updates.
The US Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Response Team (USCERT) issued an alert to the security industry on Wednesday advising SAP customers what they need to do to plug the holes.
It is one of only three such security warnings the agency has issued so far this year.
Dozens of companies have been exposed to these security gaps in recent years, and a far larger number of SAP customers remain vulnerable, said Onapsis, a firm that specialises in securing business applications from SAP and rival Oracle.
"This is not a new vulnerability," Mariano Nunez, CEO of Onapsis, which works with SAP to plug security holes, told Reuters in advance of the US security alert.
