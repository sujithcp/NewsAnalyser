(Use headphones to fully experience the binaural sound in this video)
Hear what virtual reality sound is really like and feel sounds coming at you from all directions.
Virtual reality can provide an immersive visual experience - because the video can give you 360 degree vision.
But the sound is less immersive because it remains static.
A VR voice sounds the same whether it is coming from an image in front or behind you.
A technique called binaural recording can be used to create a more realistic, three-dimensional experience, but the effect only works if your head stays still while listening - and in virtual reality you can turn your head in all directions.
The team is also looking at ways to standardise all the 3D audio information so it sounds best on whatever sound system it is played on including web browsers.
