State-run BSNL Thursday said it has registered the highest growth rate in
providing new wireless connections during February this year, beating
all private operators.
BSNL has a growth rate of 1.67 percent,
followed by Bharti Airtel with 1.18 percent, Vodafone with 1.04 percent and Idea Cellular with 0.85 percent whereas the industry average
stood at 0.85 percent.
State-run BSNL added 13.93 lakh subscribers to increase its base to 8.48 crore.
Bharti Airtel added 29 lakh subscribers to take its base to 24.86 crore at the
end of February whereas Vodafone added 20.34 lakh users and its base
increased to 19.67 crore.
Idea Cellular added 14.63 lakh
subscribers to increase its base to 17.46 crore and Reliance
Communications added 6.99 lakh users to take its base to 10.19 crore.
Commenting
on the feat achieved by BSNL, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told
PTI, "This is a matter of great satisfaction that BSNL has left behind
private telcos in growth rate.
This only shows that hard work,
dedication and strict monitoring at the political level, public sector
units (PSUs) can do well and give competition to private telcos."
BSNL said its field units have synergised their efforts to achieve this target.
"Our
MNP (Port in/Port out ratio) has become first time positive in FY
2015-16, meaning thereby that the number of customers joining BSNL from
other operators is more than the customers leaving BSNL.
We are thankful
to our customers for reposing faith in us.
We are committed to provide
the best services to our customers," Director (CM) BSNL Board R K Mittal
said.
