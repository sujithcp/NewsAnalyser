"Group Admins of each group will be responsible for all the posts on their groups & for any irresponsible remarks/deals leading to untoward incidents will be dealt under law," read one circular, signed by the Kupwara District Magistrate's office.
It also forbade government employees who are part of these groups from "making comments/ remarks" about the policies and decisions of the government.
"This is scapegoating by appointing the admin as a whipping boy or girl because authorities wish to find someone to punish for dissemination of objectionable information," said Mishi Choudhary, executive director at the Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC).
WhatsApp recently provided end-to-end encryption on its platform, which means that only the intended recipient (person or group) communicating with each other can see the message that is being sent over the messaging service.
Experts say the legality of such a directive is questionable, but even more worrisome is how the government plans to "look at" conversations among citizens on WhatsApp.
"This is impractical and will be very difficult to monitor short of a dystopic system that encourage citizens to spy on each other.
Even if WhatsApp is shut down, other applications will take its place," said Chinmayi Arun, Executive Director, Centre for Communication Governance, National Law University, Delhi.
While the circulars do not clarify how the conversations will be monitored, the only feasible way to do it is if the district magistrate or a government official is added to existing WhatsApp groups.
Besides, if an admin exits a group, WhatsApp randomly assigns admin status to any one of the group members, according to WhatsApp's terms of service.
"Ergo, merely your presence in a group can implicate you for content posted by others.
This shows lack of understanding on how apps work or law applies to such situations," added SFLC's Choudhary.
However, rumor mongering is also a valid concern, especially in a volatile state like Jammu and Kashmir.
"Incitement to violence is a serious concern and WhatsApp needs to start engaging more with policy makers and others who work on human rights.
Unlike the other major platforms that do discuss their policies and contemporary problems, WhatsApp seems to be less inclined to engage.
I hope that this will change," added CCG's Arun.
An email sent to Facebook, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014, was not answered at the time of going to print.
While there are other apps available, what makes WhatsApp unique is its scale- it has nearly a billion monthly active users in February, and India is considered one of their largest markets.
ET had earlier reported law enforcement agencies' concerns over WhatsApp not being forthcoming in investigations.
However, Internet shutdowns have become the go to solution for state governments dealing with the spread of negative information in times of crisis.
This year alone, there have been five instances of statewide Internet shutdowns in Haryana, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, according to data compiled by SFLC .

NEW DELHI: The J&K government wants to tune into every WhatsApp group chat in the state, if recent directives are to be believed.
Two different communiques that went out on Monday asked WhatsApp group admins of "social media news agencies" and "WahtsApp news groups" to register with the local administration, in order to prevent untoward incidents in the state.
The directives follow an incident that led to the death of four people in a firing by security forces.
