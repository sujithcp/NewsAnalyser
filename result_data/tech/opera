Opera has now integrated ad blocker to its browsers on Windows PCs as well as to mobile, starting with Opera Mini browser for Android.
The company stated that by integrating the ad-blocker technology directly into the browser code, the new Opera for computers will speed up page loading by 89 percent compared to browsing without ad blocking.
It is also 45 percent faster compared to Google Chrome with third-party ad-blocking extensions installed.
For mobile users, there is an added advantage to removing online ads, and that is saving money on the data bill.
By blocking ads, Opera Mini users can achieve up to an additional 14 percent in data savings on top of that, so that less is deducted from a user’s mobile data allowance.
By removing online adds, Opera Mini is expected to load webpages 40 percent faster than with the ad blocker disabled.
“Opera is the first browser company to offer an native ad blocker across devices.
We do this because we want to provide people with the fastest browsers in the market.
Our speed test shows that online ads slow down the browsing experience.
Now, with Opera, you can browse a lot faster than, for example, in Chrome,” said Lars Boilesen, CEO, Opera.
