Autodesk, a leader in 3D design technology, today announced it will provide advanced design technology to local MSMEs from the manufacturing sector as per a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Maharashtra government.
Beginning May 5, 2016, Fusion 360, Autodesk's cloud-based software tool for Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) will be made available for free (subject to satisfying relevant criteria) to MSMEs registered with the Department of Industries and with annual turnover less than Rs 100,000,00.
Additionally for MSMEs in Maharashtra with an annual turnover over Rs 1 crore the software will be available at a price of Rs 1,999 (plus taxes) with a two years validity, through the Mahaonline portal.
This initiative was agreed upon between Autodesk and the Maharashtra government during the Make in India week in February.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, "This will enable our MSMEs to uniquely design and manufacture their products as per international standards.
This partnership of Government of Maharashtra and Autodesk will create a potential for Maharashtra MSMEs to become globally competitive and locally productive."
Autodesk also launched the customer showcase portal www.bharatfusion360.com which will help promote the work of MSMEs who derive greater business success by using Fusion 360.
Further, the company will help the MSMEs to showcase their work at national and international platforms.
Autodesk would also be training around 8000 franchisees in the state on the optimum usage of Fusion 360 design platform.
"Today, with Cloud technology, it's possible to democratise design.
As the pioneer in delivering the entire product development process on a cloud-based platform, Autodesk is uniquely positioned to enable Indian MSMEs to leapfrog to world class manufacturing capability," said Pradeep Nair, Managing Director, Autodesk, India & SAARC.
Fusion 360 is a complete CAD, CAM and collaborative product development platform available on the cloud.
It helps move easily between industrial design & mechanical engineering with direct, freeform and parametric modeling.
It saves the extra cost for data management, simulation and visualisation.
It enables you to work online, offline, Mac, PC or mobile.
