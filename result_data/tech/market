MUMBAI: Mahindra & Mahindra has turned the tables on Tata Motors, the nation's largest commercial vehicle maker, in the market for mini trucks, or small commercial vehicles.From being a strong challenger a few years ago, Mahindra has not only overtaken Tata Motors as the largest small commercial vehicle maker, but also extended the lead to 15% in the load or cargo carrying truck segment â€” Mahindra has a 52% market share here, compared with 37% for Tata Motors.
If the passenger carrying versions of pickups are included, Mahindra's share is 49% compared with Tata Motors' 41%.
Tata Motors, which is being credited for creating a mini truck space over a decade back with the Ace, is being challenged on all fronts.
The company has seen a whopping 22% fall in market share in the past four years in its bread-and-butter minitruck space.
The small commercial vehicle segment has been struggling for three years, with slow industrial activity and financiers withdrawing from the segment hurting sales.
The overall small commercial vehicle market has shrunk to 3.34 lakh units in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from 5.6 lakh units three years prior.
In this sliding market, the fortunes of Tata Motors also changed.
The mini-truck market has two sub-segments.
In the category below 2 tonnes, Tata Motors is still the king with the Ace family, and has more than 70% of the market share.
In the 2-3.5 tonne pickup truck space, however, Mahindra is the leader by far, with close to a 70% share.
In fiscal 2016, Tata Motors' market share in the sub-2 tonne segment fell 10%.
At the same time, Mahindra gained more than 12% in this segment share with an increase of 80% in sales, led by the Jeeto model in the sub-2 tonne market.
However, Tata Motors did gain back volumes and market share of about 4-5% in the pickup truck category post the introduction of new products.
"It is our wide range of products, all the way from half-a-tonne to sub-3.5-tonne space, at every subsegment and at every price point, that gives us the edge over competition," Veejay Ram Nakra, Mahindra's senior V-P of sales and customer care at the automotive division, told ET during the recent launch of the big Bolero pickup.
"Along with our portfolio, the push in rural areas with focus on 3,000 tehsils across the country will help us consolidate our presence further," he said.
In the past three years, Tata Motors was hurt not only by the shrinking market, but also because it didn't have many options in pickup trucks when migration from small trucks to pickup trucks was in full swing.
A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company practically owned the entire category (years back), so the market share was bound to change.
Alluding to losing segment share in small passenger space and regaining it back to 85%, the spokesperson said due to various market dynamics, including market recession and market player interventions, there has been stronger growth in the pickup category in the recent years, driven by healthy rate of urbanisation.
And given this was not Tata Motors traditional strength, the market share has seen erosion.
But in the past one year, with new launches like the Ace Mega and Super Ace Mint filling the gaps in the product portfolio, the company has made acomeback in the last two quarters.
"Tata Motors continues to remain focussed on driving sustainable profitable market growth, through customer-centric products and solutions rather than temporary market share gains.
With many new launches including those filling in specific niches and customer-friendly initiatives to reinvigorate our go-tomarket strategy, we will look to consolidate our gains for sustained market leadership," the spokesperson added.
