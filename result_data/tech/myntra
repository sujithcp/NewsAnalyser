Fashion e-tailer Myntra today said it expects 15-20% of its sales to come from its desktop website, which will be re-launched next month.
A year after going app-only, fashion e-tailer Myntra has now decided to re-launch its desktop website from June 1.
"The re-launch of a full-fledged site is aimed to provide convenience to a segment of customers, especially women customers, who have a marked preference for browsing and shopping on multiple platforms such as mobile, tablet & desktop," Myntra said in a statement.
Myntra, part of e-commerce giant Flipkart, had attributed its earlier decision to go 'mobile-only' from May last year to the manifold growth in traffic from smartphones.
Stating that its mobile strategy had witnessed huge success, Myntra said it had seen 70% growth and become the most loved mobile app among leading Indian e-commerce firms over the last year.
"Despite the many clear positives, the company has decided to revisit its strategy and re-launch the desktop site.
The biggest reason for this is the feedback from Myntra's consumers," it said.
An internal study also suggested that Myntra could expand its customer base by 20% if it allowed users the flexibility of using multiple platforms for shopping, it added.
"Myntra expects 15-20% of its sales to come from the website," the statement said.
Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan said while it is still true that the mobile experience is far superior to the web, "we have recognised that some consumers still want the option to shop on the web and we're humble enough to listen to our customers".
According to Google Play Store, Myntra's app has seen over 10 million downloads.
Following Myntra, many Internet-based services companies had begun contemplating going app-only with the likes of Ola announcing the same.
There were indications that Myntra's parent firm Flipkart might itself take that route.
