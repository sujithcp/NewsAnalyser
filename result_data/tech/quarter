Nishtha Saluja NEW DELHI: Samsung, Micromax and Intex lead the overall and smartphone markets in India for the quarter ended March, during which 52.8 million handsets were shipped - down 4% on-year - even as the Rs 10,000-15,000 price segment contributed about 22% to smartphone shipments in the quarter, overtaking the Rs 6,000-8,000 band that is typically the largest contributor to total sales, a first for the industry.
The contribution of Indian brands was at an all-time high of 45%, up 7% compared to 4Q'15, while the handsets made out of India contributed around 67% to the sales, Cybermedia Research said Tuesday, in its report for the first quarter.
"The increase (in Rs 10,000-15,000 price band) has been primarily due to introduction of shipments by LeEco and launch of new handsets / significant increase in shipments from Lenovo, Oppo, LG, Panasonic, Micromax, Intex, LYF (RJio) and Vivo," Faisal Kawoosa,the Lead Analyst at CMR's Telecom Practice said.
Some of the Smartphones that have done exceptionally well in this price band include Lenovo's K4 Note, LeEco's Le 1S, Micromax's Canvas Mega 4G, Huawei's Honor 5X and Intex's Aqua Freedom, the research firm added.
The contribution by Chinese and other global brands, however, has declined remarkably on a sequential basis.
India shipped a total of 52.8 million handsets in first quarter 2016, against 55.4 million same period last year.
The decline was 12.8% on-quarter.
The research also found that as of 1Q'16, 67% of the shipments were being made in India.
Among the handsets produced out of India, 66% of the smartphones and 60% of the 4G smartphones were manufactured locally.
"The apprehension that many had in the industry about attracting obsolete technology is proven wrong.
Now, it is time to look at the premium segment where the contribution is negligible," Kawoosa added.
The report further identified a surge in the average selling prices for smartphones.
While in the 4Q'15, the average selling price for a smartphone was Rs 12,285, this has shot up to Rs 12,983 in 1Q'16.
The same was Rs 10,364 in the first quarter of 2015.
Krishna Mukherjee, Analyst, Telecoms at CMR said, "Rankings of major players remain static; Samsung secured the top slot, followed by Micromax and Intex.
While the global players are increasingly focusing on 4G LTE technology, domestic players could still see some profits in 3G technology.
Moving forward, it would be all about 4G LTE and 2016 is the year when a major transformation is expected in the telecom sector with respect to change in technology."
In the second quarter, we are waiting to see how Micromax performs after tweaking its brand logo and creating a new approach towards marketing and sales strategy, Krishna added.
