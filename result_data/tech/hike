The hike ‘microapp’ enables the user to creat an eCard by uploading the picture or stickers which they can share on their timeline.
Indian messaging app hike has launched a “microapp” for its messenger users on the occasion of Mother’s Day.
“The Mother’s Day micro-app will let you create personalized cards with a picture and a special message for your moms and you’ll also be able to share it with your friends to let them know how much you love your moms,” hike wrote in its blog.
The ‘microapp’ enables the user to creat an eCard by uploading the picture or stickers which they can share on their timeline.
“You can then post these cards and stickers on your timeline, or share amongst your friends, not only on Hike but also on any other platform of your choice,” added hike.
There are over 100 million users on hike and every user is able to use the Mother’s Day ‘microapp’ for two days.
