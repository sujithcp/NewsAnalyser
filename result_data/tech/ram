Samsung has just launched its Galaxy J5 (2016) and Galaxy J7 (2016) smartphones in India.
The Galaxy J5 has been priced at Rs 13,990 while the bigger (and should be we say better) Galaxy J7 is priced at Rs 15,990.
Both smartphones pack in decent internal hardware as well.
The Samsung J5 packs in a 5.2-inch HD Super AMOLED display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (unconfirmed) clocked at 1.2GHz, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage and a 3100mAh battery.
Coming to the Samsung Galaxy J7, you do get a bit more.
There a 5.5-inch Full HD display on the front, an Exynos 1.6GHz chipset inside, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that is now powered by a 3300mAh battery.
Both units get a 13MP, f/1.9 aperture rear camera that is accompanied by an LED flash and a 5MP front-facing camera for selfies that is also accompanied by a LED flash.
For now there are no details as to which sensors Samsung has used in these handsets, but if they are the same ones from the A5 and A7 , owners could be in for a surprise when it comes to camera performance.
4G LTE bands, NFC, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth v4.1.
Samsung has also included Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the package, which will indeed make for a sweeter deal.
Comparing it to the rest of the competition in the same price range, there’s Motorola’s Moto G Turbo Edition that is priced at Rs 12,499 and packs in a Snapdragon 615 chipset with 2GB of RAM, offers a stock Nexus-like UI and even an IP6X rating for water resistance.
Another handset that stands up to the J7 in particular, is the Motorola Moto X Play which packs in a 21MP camera, better battery life, a Snapdragon 615, a 5.5-inch Full HD display and is priced at Rs 16,999 for the 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM model.
Then there’s LeEco’s Le 1s revival with the recently launched LeEco Le 1 Eco at Rs 9,999.
Odd naming convention aside, you do get a lot of performance for the price that is a lot lower than both of Samsung’s new J series smartphones.
There’s no Super AMOLED display, but Le 1 Eco delivers plenty with a Full HD IPS LCD display, a MediaTek Helio X10, 3GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and fingerprint reader on the back.
Talking about performance, there indeed is no other smartphone that delivers performance figures that are way above its category like Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 .
The Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 will give you performance that is good enough to beat last year’s flagship smartphone, beginning from Rs 9,999 for the 2GB RAM with 16GB storage model or Rs 11,999 for the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage model.
And let’s not forget that 4050mAh battery that should deliver better battery life than all of the above mentioned handsets as well.
All-in-all, there’s little to defend Samsung’s 2016 offering of the Galaxy J5 and J7 apart from their Super AMOLED displays, support for microSD cards and Android Marshmallow.
However, all of this is only on paper, and if our speculation turns out to be true, users could be looking at class-leading camera performance as well.
So look out for our full review of both of these smartphones to know if they really make a difference or are they simply a case of old wine in a new bottle.
