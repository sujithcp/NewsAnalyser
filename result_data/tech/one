A one-on-one fighter
Back in the day when one-on-one fighters like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat ruled, there was another small game called Killer Instinct that dominated arcades with its unique characters and superb fighting mechanics.
In 2013, like a phoenix rising, Killer Instinct was back, as a free-to-play fighting game available on Xbox One and Windows PC.
Now years later, its third season has arrived.
Killer Instinct is about two fighters entering an arena and one emerging victor.
The story revolves around a mega-corporation that holds a tournament called Killer Instinct.
You get to choose from a roster of normal fighters and “experimental” ones.
Season Three expands the roster of characters.
All about the speed, this game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second.
There’s no loss in input from the controller to what you see on the screen.
The gameplay is one-on-one fighting, but it's focused on faster combos, and each character has their own speed and moves.
The favourite in Season Three is Rash and Arbiter.
Anyone fan of Battletoads, the age-old franchise circa the time of Ninja Turtles, will love Rash's moves straight out of the classic game.
With zany costumes, Arbiter is familiar to Halo fans, using familiar weapons from the game that completes the moves, including that wicked light sword.
Not to be left out is Gargos, a fighting gargoyle, Kim Wu, a student that fights with some killer nunchucks, and Tusk, a barbarian type berserk fighter.
In addition to new characters, this season brings along fully updated visuals to compete with the new Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter games.
Yes, if you like the one-on-one fighting genre.
It's history repeating itself all over again.
